# How to Navigate

## Overview
This guide explains how to locate key information and contribute efficiently
within this repository.

## Why It Matters
Following a consistent navigation approach helps all contributors find the right
resources quickly and reduces ramp-up time.

## Audience, Scope & Personas
- New contributors
- Experienced maintainers who need a refresher

## Prerequisites
- Familiarity with Git and GitHub basics

## Security, Compliance & Privacy
Always review directory-specific `AGENTS.md` files for security and compliance
guidelines before committing changes.

## Tasks & Step-by-Step Instructions
1. Start at the top-level `README.md` for a high-level overview of the
   repository structure.
2. Navigate into each folder and read the local `README.md` to understand its
   purpose.
3. Consult the appropriate `AGENTS.md` for required writing standards and
   security considerations.
4. Use the `docs/` directory for additional references like the glossary and
   workflow explanations.

## Access Control & Permissions (RBAC guidelines)
Most documentation is publicly readable. Merge permissions are limited to the
maintainers specified in `CODEOWNERS`.

## Practical Examples & Templates (✅/❌)
✅ "Refer to `/05-automation-ci-cd/README.md` for CI/CD guidelines."

❌ "Just guess which folder holds the automation docs."

## Known Issues & Friction Points
- Large directory trees can feel overwhelming at first glance.
- Some files may have overlapping information.

## Tips & Best Practices
- Use GitHub's search to locate files quickly.
- Bookmark the `docs/` directory for reference material.

## Troubleshooting Guidance
If a link in any README or documentation appears broken, open an issue so it can
be corrected promptly.

## Dependencies, Risks & Escalation Path
- Navigation relies on accurate README and `AGENTS.md` content.
- Escalate persistent confusion to repository maintainers.

## Success Metrics & Outcomes
- Contributors can locate information without assistance.
