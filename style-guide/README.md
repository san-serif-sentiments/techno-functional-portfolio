# Style Guide


**Version 1.0 • 2025-05-19**

_A living framework for calm, clear, human-first documentation._

***

## 1. Purpose of This Guide


> A style guide is not just about formatting—it's about trust.\
> This document exists to create a **shared voice**, a **clear standard**, and a **reliable starting point** for anyone contributing to sans-serif-sentiments.

You can use this guide when:

* You're writing docs, READMEs, guides, or changelogs
* You're reviewing someone else’s writing
* You’re rewriting dry tech speak into something more human

This isn’t about rules. It’s about rhythm.

***

## 2. Tone & Voice


_Calm, clear, sincere—never robotic._

Your writing should feel like a conversation with someone who’s:

* Confident but not arrogant
* Knowledgeable but not preachy
* Friendly but not trying too hard

###  What We Aim For


| Trait       | What It Means                                                            |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Calm**    | No over-explaining. No panic. No exclamation marks unless they earn it.  |
| **Clear**   | Say what you mean. Cut half your words—if it still works, it’s better.   |
| **Sincere** | Be helpful, not hypey. Avoid jargon, sarcasm, or corporate filler.       |
| **Minimal** | Don’t write a sentence when a phrase will do. Let whitespace speak.      |
| **Human**   | We talk like real people. Write like someone who wants to be understood. |

***

### ❌ Cold, Robotic


```markdown
To proceed with installation, users are advised to verify system prerequisites prior to continuing.
```

### ✅ Calm + Human


```markdown
Before you install, check if your system meets the requirements.  
It takes 30 seconds and saves frustration later.
```

***

### ❌ Corporate & Vague


```markdown
Our platform leverages AI capabilities to enhance synergies across verticals.
```

### ✅ Sincere + Clear


```markdown
We use AI to help teams work faster and with fewer manual tasks.
```

***

### ❌ Friendly but Overdone


```markdown
Hey there, champ! 😎 Ready to install some software?! Let’s crush it! 💥
```

### ✅ Friendly and Respectful


```markdown
Let’s get you set up. This guide takes about 3 minutes to follow.
```

***

> Write like you're helping someone intelligent—but tired.\
> That’s the reader who matters most.

***

## 3. Structure & Hierarchy


_When and how to use headings and whitespace._

Your doc should feel like a conversation with chapters—not a cluttered note.

***

###  Use heading levels to guide the eye:


| Markdown  | Purpose                                  |
| --------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| `#` H1    | Title of the page (only once per doc)    |
| `##` H2   | Major sections                           |
| `###` H3  | Subsections under an H2                  |
| `####` H4 | Rarely needed—only for edge-case nesting |

✅ Use **1 blank line** before and after headings.\
✅ Start each section with a quick sentence or blockquote for orientation.

***

### ❌ Cluttered Heading Use


```markdown
# How it Works

## Setup

### Token

#### Details

### Login

### Interface

```

### ✅ Clear Hierarchy


```markdown
# How It Works


## 1. Setup


### Generate a Token  

Explain what it does and why it’s needed.

### Log In  

Describe what users should expect.

## 2. Using the Interface  

Quick intro before listing features.
```

***

###   Numbering Style Guidelines


* ✅ Use numbers in the TOC for scanning and structure
* ❌ Do not include numbering in actual document headings (`##`).

> This keeps URLs clean, anchors intuitive, and editing easier.

> **When numbering can help:**
>
> * In a tutorial or linear flow where readers need to track “Step 1, Step 2…”
> * When you’ll reference sections by number in discussion or reviews.
>
> **Pros of numbering headings:**
>
> * Clarifies sequence and progress
> * Makes it easy to say “see section 3”
>
> **Cons of numbering headings:**
>
> * Pollutes anchor links and permalinks
> * Requires renumbering whenever you insert or reorder sections
> * Can distract in long or non-linear docs
>
> **Hybrid model:**\
> Use numbers in the TOC only for order, but keep your `##` headings unnumbered for clean URLs and easier maintenance.

***

###   Leading Sentences Guidelines


* ✅ Always start a new section or procedural list with a brief intro sentence that explains **why** the reader is here.
* ❌ Avoid jumping straight into steps without context.
* #### 📌 📝 (More Examples)

| ❌ Don’t Do This                                                            | ✅ Do This Instead                                                                                                                               |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| <p>1. Clone the repo<br>2. Install dependencies<br>3. Start the server</p> | <p>Before you start the server, make sure your environment is ready:<br>1. Clone the repo<br>2. Install dependencies<br>3. Start the server</p> |
| <p>1. Add user to group<br>2. Grant permissions<br>3. Notify user</p>      | <p>To onboard a new user, follow these steps:<br>1. Add the user to the group<br>2. Grant permissions<br>3. Notify the user</p>                 |
| <p>1. Download the ZIP<br>2. Extract files<br>3. Run installer</p>         | <p>Before installing, download and extract the package:<br>1. Download the ZIP<br>2. Extract files<br>3. Run the installer</p>                  |
| <p>1. Write tests<br>2. Execute tests<br>3. Review results</p>             | <p>To verify your changes, write and run tests:<br>1. Write tests<br>2. Execute tests<br>3. Review results</p>                                  |

> A quick orienting or opening line sets expectations and reduces confusion.

***

###   Heading Consistency & Parallelism


* ✅ Write related headings in the same grammatical form (e.g., all imperatives: “Install,” “Configure,” “Verify”).
* ❌ Don’t mix styles like “Installing the Tool” with “Setup Instructions.”
* #### 📌 🔗 (More Examples)

| ❌ Mixed Styles                                                                          | ✅ Parallel Imperatives                                                           |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| <p>## Installing the Tool<br>## How to Configure Your Account<br>## Verifying Setup</p> | <p>## Install the Tool<br>## Configure Your Account<br>## Verify the Setup</p>   |
| <p>## Setup Instructions<br>## Troubleshooting Errors<br>## Configuration Options</p>   | <p>## Set Up the Tool<br>## Troubleshoot Errors<br>## Configure Options</p>      |
| <p>## Editing Profiles<br>## Profile Settings Overview<br>## How to Save Changes</p>    | <p>## Edit Your Profile<br>## View Profile Settings<br>## Save Your Changes</p>  |
| <p>## User Management<br>## Roles and Permissions<br>## Managing Access</p>             | <p>## Manage Users<br>## Assign Roles &#x26; Permissions<br>## Manage Access</p> |

> Parallel structure helps readers scan and know exactly what to expect.

***

###  Good vs Bad Examples Summary Table


| ❌ Don’t Do This                                      | ✅ Do This Instead                                                     |
| ---------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Use numbered section headings like `## 3. Structure` | Use `## Structure` and reserve numbers only for the TOC               |
| Skip a framing sentence before a list of steps       | Add a sentence: “Before you configure, make sure you’ve installed X.” |
| Mix verb forms in headings                           | Keep all headings imperative: “Download,” “Install,” “Verify”         |
| Nest headings deeply without cause                   | Use up to 3 levels unless absolutely required                         |
| Skip spacing between sections                        | Add whitespace before/after headings and between paragraphs           |
| Include all concepts in one bloated section          | Split into logical sub-headings to improve scanning                   |

***

##  Whitespace = Breathing Room


Use whitespace like punctuation. It slows the scroll and helps the eye.

***

### ❌ Wall of Text


```markdown
To install the CLI tool, go to the website and download the installer. After that, run the installer and follow the setup wizard. Finally, verify the installation by typing `tool --version` in the terminal.
```

### ✅ Structured & Skimmable


````markdown
### Install the CLI Tool


1. Go to the [Downloads page](#)
2. Run the installer
3. Follow the setup wizard

✅ To confirm it worked:
```bash
tool --version
````

````

---

> ✅ Structure isn’t just for looks. It tells the reader:  
> “You’re in good hands. Keep going.”

---

###  Use whitespace like punctuation


- One thought = one paragraph  
- Use bullets or tables instead of dense text  
- Group related content with clear spacing

> If it looks dense, it reads dense.

---

## 4. Emphasis Rules  

_Use emphasis to guide—not distract._

Use `**bold**` and `*italic*` intentionally. Don’t shout. Don’t decorate.

| Use case | Style |
|----------|-------|
| Highlight a key term | `**bold**` |
| Add nuance or light stress | `*italic*` |
| Reference file/code | `` `inline code` `` |
| Technical snippets/output | Triple backticks (```bash) |

---

### ❌ Overdone & Distracting

```markdown
**IMPORTANT**: You MUST click the **FINAL** button at the **END** of the page.
````

### ✅ Balanced and Focused


```markdown
Click the **Final** button at the end of the page.  
This step completes the setup.
```

***

### ❌ Emphasizing full sentences


```markdown
**You should always check the version before upgrading.**
```

### ✅ Use emphasis _within_ the sentence


```markdown
You should always check the **version** before upgrading.
```

> ✅ Let emphasis **support meaning**—not add noise.

***

## 5. Language & Word Choice


_Preferred words, banned jargon._

### ✅ Use simple, common words:


| Bad                  | Better                  |
| -------------------- | ----------------------- |
| Utilize              | Use                     |
| Leverage (as a verb) | Apply, use              |
| Facilitate           | Help                    |
| Navigate to          | Go to                   |
| Interface (as noun)  | Screen, page, dashboard |
| In order to          | To                      |

### ❌ Avoid these patterns:


* "It is recommended that…" → say “We recommend…”
* “At your earliest convenience…” → say “When you’re ready”
* “Endeavor to…” → just… don’t.

***

### ❌ Vague, bloated


```markdown
Our solution facilitates synergistic workflows across multiple platforms.
```

### ✅ Specific, human


```markdown
Our tool helps teams work together across different apps—without switching tabs.
```

***

### ❌ Legalese-style


```markdown
Users are advised to initiate credential verification upon initial login.
```

### ✅ Human-first


```markdown
When you log in for the first time, we’ll ask you to verify your account.
```

> Write like you're helping a smart friend, not submitting to a legal department.

***

## 6. Layout Patterns


_Common structures for different doc types._

Use these reusable layouts to speed up writing and bring consistency across docs.

###  Setup Guide


```markdown
## Getting Started


> What this guide helps you do in under 5 minutes.

### Step 1: Install XYZ  

Brief one-line description.

### Step 2: Configure XYZ  

Break it into 2–3 bullets if needed.

### Step 3: Verify  

Show how success looks.
```

***

###  How-To Guide


```markdown
## How to Do One Specific Thing


> What this does and why it’s useful.

1. Step 1  
2. Step 2  
3. Step 3

✅ Result: What the user should see or achieve.
```

***

###  Concept/Overview Doc


```markdown
## What is [Concept]?


> Short, calm, non-salesy definition

- Why it matters  
- Where it fits in  
- When to use it
```

> ✨ These aren’t strict templates. Think of them as scaffolding—there to support you, not box you in.

***

## 7. Content Philosophy


_Empathy-led, human-first writing._

We don’t write to look smart.\
We write so the reader doesn’t have to feel stupid.

This guide exists to protect that principle.

***

###  Why This Philosophy Matters


Documentation is the _first real conversation_ between your product and your user.\
If that conversation is cold, robotic, or overloaded—they walk away.

***

###  What We Believe


| Principle                             | What It Means                                                        |
| ------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Writing is a product**              | Docs are part of the experience—not an afterthought                  |
| **Clarity is kindness**               | Confusion costs time. Clarity creates momentum                       |
| **Brevity isn’t the goal—clarity is** | Sometimes more words are needed to say it simply                     |
| **Anticipation builds trust**         | Predict what might confuse the reader—and address it before they ask |
| **Tone is UX**                        | A friendly line at the right time does more than a button ever can   |

***

### ❌ A Typical, Surface-Level Doc


```markdown
The installation process requires you to download the binary, extract it, and modify your PATH variable accordingly.
```

### ✅ A Human-First Rewrite


```markdown
To install the tool:

1. Download the `.zip` file
2. Extract it to any folder
3. Add that folder to your system PATH (here’s how →)

Not sure what "PATH" means? No worries—[we’ll explain it here](#what-is-path).
```

> 🤝 Help before it’s asked for. Confidence before confusion.

***

### ❌ Corporate Legalese


```markdown
This integration utilizes proprietary methods to ensure optimal connectivity across environments.
```

### ✅ Sans-Serif Sentiments Style


```markdown
We built this integration to be reliable, fast, and easy to connect—no matter your environment.
```

> Say it like you’d say it in real life. Not like you’re talking to a boardroom.

***

## ✅ TL;DR


* People don’t read docs because they _want_ to. They read them because they’re stuck.
* We don’t waste their time trying to sound impressive—we respect it by being helpful.
* Empathy isn’t a “nice-to-have”—it’s our UX strategy in writing.

> Clarity is the kindest thing we can offer someone mid-problem.

***

## 8. Markdown & Commit Style


_The backbone of formatting clarity._

Markdown is the shared language of your documentation.\
Used well, it brings structure and calm. Used carelessly, it creates chaos.

***

### ✅ Markdown Guidelines


| Task        | Rule                                        |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| Code blocks | Use triple backticks: \`\`\`bash            |
| Inline code | Use backticks: \`filename.txt\`             |
| Headings    | One `#` per level, no skipping              |
| Lists       | Use `-` or numbered lists (avoid asterisks) |
| Links       | Use `[text](url)` syntax—no raw URLs        |

✅ Always use **one blank line** between headings, paragraphs, and list items.\
✅ Use indentation sparingly; avoid nested chaos.

***

### ❗ Common Markdown Mistakes to Avoid


| Mistake                      | Better Approach                                              |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Mixing `*` and `-` in lists  | Stick with `-` for all unordered items                       |
| Raw URLs                     | ❌ `https://example.com` → ✅ `[Example](https://example.com)` |
| No blank lines around blocks | Markdown breaks—add spacing                                  |
| Code without context         | Always add a sentence before code to explain what it does    |

***

###  When to Use Inline vs Block Code


| Use Case                                | Use This                                   |
| --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| Referencing a file, flag, or CLI option | `` `inline code` ``                        |
| Showing steps, commands, or config      | \`\`\`block code\`\`\` with language label |

✅ Be kind to the reader:\
Use inline when referencing, block when teaching.

***

### ✅ Commit Message Style


We use **conventional commit prefixes** for clarity and changelog generation:

```bash
feat: add onboarding checklist template
fix: resolve broken anchor link in API doc
docs: rewrite intro paragraph for tone
refactor: reorganize folder structure
chore: update dependencies
```

✅ Use **present tense** (`add`, not `added`)\
✅ Keep subject lines under 72 characters\
✅ Use lowercase prefixes (no `Feat:` or `Fix:`)

***

###  Why It Matters


Your commit history is not just a log—it’s a **narrative**.\
Clear messages help:

* Auto-generate changelogs
* Scan history during debugging
* Guide code reviewers faster

> A good commit is a small act of documentation.

***

## 9. Accessibility & Inclusivity


_Alt-text, plain language, and respect for real-world readers._

Accessibility isn't just about screen readers.\
It’s about making your docs usable by people who are tired, rushed, anxious, distracted—or differently abled.

That includes:

* Screen reader users
* Non-native English speakers
* Colorblind users
* Newcomers who don’t know your product (yet)

***

###  Core Principles


| Principle                               | What It Means                                       |
| --------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| **Clarity is accessibility**            | Dense, jargon-heavy text excludes readers           |
| **Alt-text is not optional**            | Every image should explain its meaning or context   |
| **Structure aids navigation**           | Headings, spacing, and order help users skim        |
| **Link labels should describe action**  | Never say "click here"                              |
| **Tone should respect all backgrounds** | No idioms, jokes, or references that might alienate |

***

### ❌ Inaccessible Example


```markdown
Hey! Click here to learn more! 🎉

![Graph](graph.png)
```

### ✅ Inclusive Rewrite


```markdown
Want a deeper explanation? [Read the API example guide](../examples/remapped-api.md)

![Line graph showing API response time decreasing after optimization](../assets/images/api-speed.png)
```

✅ The alt text explains what the graph _means_, not just what it _is_.

***

###  Tools That Help


* [Hemingway Editor](https://hemingwayapp.com/) – Simplify complex sentences
* [WAVE Accessibility Tool](https://wave.webaim.org/) – Audit contrast, alt text, etc.
* [Inclusive Language Checker](https://alexjs.com/) – Detect biased or outdated terms

***

###  TL;DR


* Add alt text that makes sense out of context
* Write like your reader has one eye on the clock and one hand on their toddler
* Don’t assume knowledge—or perfect English
* Never use “click here” as link text
* Keep sentence structure light, clean, and logically ordered

> Accessibility isn’t extra effort. It’s built-in empathy.

***

## 10. Localization & Translation


_Placeholder syntax, tone shifts, and global awareness._

Good docs speak many languages—even when they’re only written in one.

Localization doesn’t start with translation.\
It starts with writing that’s clear, culture-neutral, and easy to adapt.

***

###  Key Practices for Localization-Friendly Writing


| Practice                                        | Why It Matters                                       |
| ----------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| **Keep sentences short**                        | Easier to translate, less room for misinterpretation |
| **Avoid idioms, slang, or cultural references** | Not all metaphors cross borders                      |
| **Use consistent terminology**                  | Reduces translation ambiguity                        |
| **Don’t hardcode values or labels**             | Keep UI strings and placeholders separate            |
| **Use neutral date/time formats**               | Prefer ISO: `YYYY-MM-DD`, `14:00 UTC`                |

***

### ❌ Bad for Translation


```markdown
You’ve nailed it—time to kick things off! 🎉  
Click “Go” and let’s roll!
```

### ✅ Localization-Friendly Version


```markdown
You're ready to begin.  
Click **Go** to start the process.
```

> 🎯 Be specific, not clever. Translators will thank you.

***

###  Placeholder Format


When writing text that will include dynamic values (e.g., usernames, file paths), use clear and localizable syntax:

✅ Use:

```markdown
Welcome, `{username}`.  
Your report is saved to `{filepath}`.
```

Avoid:

```markdown
Welcome, $username! Your file is in $path
```

***

###  Helpful Tools


* [Phrase](https://phrase.com) – Translation management platform
* [Crowdin](https://crowdin.com) – Collaborative localization for docs
* [LocalizationLint](https://github.com/DavidAnson/markdownlint) – Lint for localization issues in Markdown

***

###  TL;DR


* Write for translation by writing clearly
* Avoid wordplay and ambiguity
* Use placeholders, not hardcoded strings
* Respect language direction, spacing, and tone

> If your doc can’t travel, it can’t scale.

***

## 11. Linking & Cross-Referencing


_Teaching users how to navigate like pros._

A good link is like a guidepost. It’s clear, descriptive, and helps the reader move forward confidently—without friction or confusion.

***

###  Link Types & Formats


| Type               | Format                          | Example                                        |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Same page (anchor) | `[text](#section-name)`         | `[Go to Setup](#setup-guide)`                  |
| Another file       | `[text](../folder/filename.md)` | `[Style Guide](../STYLE-GUIDE/STYLE-GUIDE.md)` |
| External           | `[text](https://url.com)`       | `[Visit GitHub](https://github.com)`           |

✅ Anchor links are based on the heading text, all lowercase, spaces → `-`, and special characters removed.

***

### ❌ Poor Linking Practices


```markdown
Click [here](https://example.com) to continue.

See [this](../other.md).

Follow this link to [go back](#).
```

### ✅ Clean, Descriptive Links


```markdown
To view our API setup process, [read the Setup Guide](../docs/api-setup.md).

Need the full changelog? [Check the release notes →](../RELEASES.md)

Want to jump ahead? [Skip to Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting)
```

***

###  Internal Anchors: How They Work


GitHub automatically creates an anchor link for every heading.

```markdown
## How to Install → becomes → #how-to-install

## FAQ & Troubleshooting → #faq--troubleshooting

```

Rules:

* Use all lowercase
* Replace spaces with hyphens `-`
* Keep punctuation out unless it’s `&` or `-` (GitHub supports double hyphens for `&`)

✅ Examples:

```markdown
[Jump to Troubleshooting](#faq--troubleshooting)

[See the Doc Types section](#5-doc-types--examples)
```

***

###  Best Practices


* ✅ Link nouns, not verbs:\
  ❌ `Click here to learn more` → ✅ `Learn more about [markdown formatting]`
* ✅ Test all links in the final rendered view (not just raw Markdown)
* ✅ Keep anchor links updated if headings change

## 12. Code & Command Snippets


_Highlight with clarity, not clutter._

Code blocks aren’t just for developers—they’re clarity boosters.\
Done right, they make your docs feel helpful, visual, and skimmable.

***

###  Code Block Guidelines


| Rule                                | ✅ Do This                          |
| ----------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Use triple backticks                | \`\`\`bash (or json, html, etc.)   |
| Label the language                  | Enables syntax highlighting        |
| No dollar sign in terminal commands | Makes it easy to copy              |
| Use inline code for filenames/flags | `` `README.md` ``, `` `--debug` `` |
| Show example output when relevant   | Help readers verify results        |

***

### ❌ Poorly Formatted Example


```markdown
To install, run the command below:

$ npm install my-package
Then run it.
npm start
```

### ✅ Structured, Clear Version


````markdown
## Install the Package


```bash
npm install my-package
````

## Run the App


```bash
npm start
```

````

> 🧠 Avoid putting `$` before commands—it breaks copy-paste.

---

### ❌ Unlabeled, Unreadable JSON

```markdown
````

{ "success": true, "msg": "OK" }

```
```

### ✅ Properly Labeled JSON Block


```json
{
  "success": true,
  "msg": "OK"
}
```

***

### ✅ Inline Code Best Practices


Use inline code (with single backticks) for:

* Filenames: `` `config.yaml` ``
* Flags: `` `--force` ``
* Paths: `` `/usr/local/bin` ``

> Avoid bold or quotes for technical terms. Use `inline code` instead.

***

###  TL;DR


| ❌ Don't                      | ✅ Do                                 |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Mix code and paragraph text  | Separate it out visually             |
| Skip labeling                | Use `bash`, `json`, `sh`, `js`, etc. |
| Use `$` in front of CLI code | Leave it out for easy copying        |
| Forget output examples       | Help readers verify success          |

> If the user has to squint at the code block, you’ve already lost them.

***

## 13. Admonitions & Callouts


_⚠️ warnings, 💡 tips, ✅ examples._

Documentation isn’t just about **telling**—it’s about **guiding**.\
That means you need more than paragraphs. You need signals.

Admonitions (also called "callouts") help readers:

* Slow down before breaking something
* Pay attention to what’s commonly missed
* Feel reassured when they’re doing it right

***

###  Types of Admonitions We Use


| Type        | Emoji    | Use It When…                                   |
| ----------- | -------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| **Note**    | 📝 or ℹ️ | You’re adding context or useful background     |
| **Tip**     | 💡       | You want to help users do it faster/smarter    |
| **Warning** | ⚠️       | A mistake here could break, delete, or confuse |
| **Example** | ✅        | You’re reinforcing a concept with a use-case   |

***

###  How to Format


#### ✅ Basic Markdown


Use blockquotes with emojis + bold labels:

```markdown
> ⚠️ **Warning:** Don’t run this command as root unless you know what you’re doing.
> 💡 **Tip:** Use `--dry-run` to preview the changes before applying them.
> ✅ **Example:** This config disables caching in local dev environments.
```

#### ✅ GitHub-Flavored Markdown (advanced)


If using a static site generator (like Docusaurus or MkDocs), you can use custom containers:

```md
:::tip
You can skip the setup step if you're using version 2.0 or later.
:::

:::warning
Never expose your API key in public repos.
:::
```

***

### ❌ Flat and Forgettable


```markdown
Be careful not to delete your database.
You can use dry-run to test it first.
```

### ✅ Structured & Supportive


```markdown
> ⚠️ **Warning:** Running this will erase all data in the `prod` environment.

> 💡 **Tip:** Add `--dry-run` to preview which records would be deleted before confirming.
```

***

###  When to Use Them


* ✅ If the reader might mess it up, use a **warning**
* ✅ If there’s a faster path, use a **tip**
* ✅ If it reinforces learning, add an **example**
* ✅ If it’s helpful but non-critical, use a **note**

> Don’t overuse them.\
> A doc full of callouts is just yelling at the user in emoji.

***

###  TL;DR


* Use callouts like a mentor: kind, honest, and clear.
* Don’t write “gotchas” after the fact—guide before the fall.
* Use structure to show empathy: **highlight what matters before it’s too late**.

***

## 14. Asset Management


_Folder conventions, image specs, and the hidden art of staying organized._

Docs are not just words.\
They’re visuals, downloads, embedded demos, diagrams, and often... a folder full of chaos.

Let’s not do that.

***

###  Folder Structure


All static assets—images, icons, charts, downloadable files—go here:

```
/assets/
   └── images/
   └── diagrams/
   └── downloads/
```

Use lowercase folder and file names, with hyphens instead of spaces: ✅ `api-flowchart.png`\
✅ `user-guide-cover.png`\
❌ `Final Version (3).PNG`

> 📌 Tip: Keep assets **outside** your `/docs/` folder to avoid URL conflicts and clutter.

***

###  Image Guidelines


| Rule        | What To Do                                                                          |
| ----------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Format      | Use `.png` for diagrams/UI, `.jpg` for photos, `.svg` for icons                     |
| Alt Text    | Every image **must** include meaningful alt text                                    |
| Dimensions  | Keep under 1200px wide unless full-screen is needed                                 |
| Compression | Use [TinyPNG](https://tinypng.com) or [Squoosh](https://squoosh.app) to reduce size |
| Naming      | Use lowercase, hyphenated, descriptive filenames                                    |

***

### ❌ Bad Practice


```markdown
![img1](../docs/random_assets/finalfinal2.PNG)
```

### ✅ Better


```markdown
![User selecting a date range in the dashboard](../../assets/images/date-filter-ui.png)
```

✅ Alt text describes what’s shown and why it matters.\
✅ Path follows clean folder structure.

***

###  Embeddable Files


If you’re including downloads (PDFs, templates, etc.), place them under `/assets/downloads/`.

Name them clearly:

* `user-onboarding-checklist.pdf`
* `quickstart-template.docx`

Avoid:

* `final-checklist2 (copy).pdf`
* `doc1.docx`

***

###  Why This Matters


* Images without structure = broken links later
* Large files = slow docs
* Confusing names = contributor rage

> Your readers may never see the asset folder—but your teammates will. Leave a trail of sanity.

***

###  TL;DR


* Use `/assets/` with clear subfolders (`images`, `downloads`, `diagrams`)
* Optimize every image—don’t dump raw screenshots
* Describe visuals with intent—**alt text is content**
* File names should be readable, reusable, and lowercase

***

## 15. Tables, Lists & Layouts


_When to use which—and why your formatting matters._

Users don’t read docs like a novel.\
They skim, scan, skip, and scroll.\
Your structure should _support that behavior—not fight it_.

***

###  When to Use a List


Use **bulleted lists** when:

* There’s no specific order
* You’re naming tools, options, concepts, requirements

```markdown
- Install Node.js
- Clone the repo
- Open the project in VS Code
```

Use **numbered lists** when:

* Steps must be followed in a specific sequence

```markdown
1. Download the installer  
2. Run the setup wizard  
3. Verify your installation
```

✅ Keep list items short and parallel in tone.\
✅ Add a one-line intro if needed:

> To install the tool, follow these steps:

***

### ❌ Common Mistakes in Bullet Lists


####  Mixed formats


```markdown
- Clone the repo
- Then install dependencies
Run the dev server after that
- Open the browser
```

✅ Fix:

```markdown
- Clone the repo  
- Install dependencies  
- Run the dev server  
- Open the browser
```

***

####  Rambly, paragraph-length bullets


```markdown
- First, you’re going to want to make sure your environment is set up correctly, which means checking Node version, Python path, and also ensuring that you have Git installed and configured properly.
```

✅ Fix:

```markdown
- Check your environment:
  - Node.js installed  
  - Python path set  
  - Git configured
```

***

####  Inconsistent grammar or tone


```markdown
- Creates the token  
- Deleting the cache  
- Used for session management
```

✅ Fix (same tense):

```markdown
- Create the token  
- Delete the cache  
- Manage session data
```

> 📌 Tip: Read your list out loud.\
> If it sounds like a ramble or grammar rollercoaster, it probably is.

***

###  When to Use a Table


Use a **table** when:

* You’re comparing values side-by-side
* Listing options, flags, configs, or multiple attributes

```markdown
| Flag        | Description                        | Default |
|-------------|------------------------------------|---------|
| `--verbose` | Enables debug output               | `false` |
| `--config`  | Path to custom config file         | `null`  |
| `--watch`   | Rebuild on file change             | `true`  |
```

✅ Keep tables narrow, clean, and skimmable\
✅ Use columns only when each one adds meaning\
❌ Avoid tables just to “make things look neat”

***

### ❌ Overdone Table


```markdown
| Step | Instruction                                                                 |
|------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1    | To begin the setup, go to the website, locate the installer, download it… |
```

✅ Use a list instead:

```markdown
### To set up:


1. Go to the [download page](#)  
2. Download the installer  
3. Run the installer and follow prompts
```

***

###  Visual Layout Patterns (Micro-Layouts)


Think in **building blocks**:

```markdown
## Heading  

> Intro sentence (optional)  
- List or short paragraph  
- Optional tip or callout  
```

Don’t:

* Nest 3+ levels deep
* Stack multiple tables back-to-back
* Mix long paragraphs into tables

***

###  TL;DR


* Lists are for flow. Tables are for side-by-side comparison.
* Don’t turn your prose into spreadsheets.
* Use consistent tense and style across list items.
* Respect your reader’s eyes—format like it matters.

> If your doc looks like a receipt or a ransom note, reformat it.

***

## 16. Terminology & Glossary


_Define and link key terms so your readers—and your writers—stay aligned._

Language isn't just what we write—it's the system that supports your product, your UX, and your docs.

This glossary is your **source of truth** for:

* What words mean
* How they’re spelled and capitalized
* When (and when not) to use them

***

###  Why It Matters


| Without a glossary                                                   | With a glossary                           |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| “Cache,” “buffer,” and “store” used interchangeably                  | Writers use the right term, every time    |
| Users confused if “project,” “workspace,” and “account” are the same | Terms are defined, linked, and consistent |
| Writers invent new phrases for the same concept                      | Everyone speaks the same doc language     |

***

###  Example Glossary Table


| Term          | Definition                                          | Use it when…                      | Don’t confuse with |
| ------------- | --------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------- | ------------------ |
| **Token**     | A temporary access credential, usually time-limited | Explaining API authentication     | Key, credential    |
| **Key**       | A long-term identifier, typically stored securely   | Describing config or setup        | Token              |
| **Workspace** | A shared environment for users and projects         | Referring to org-wide settings    | Account, project   |
| **Project**   | A single unit of work inside a workspace            | Naming or scoping builds          | Repo, workspace    |
| **Slug**      | A URL-friendly version of a name (`my-post-title`)  | Generating permalinks or doc URLs | ID, alias          |

***

###  Tips for Maintaining the Glossary


* ✅ Add a new term when:
  * You’ve used it 3+ times across docs
  * You’ve had to explain it in comments or PRs
  * It could be misinterpreted in another language
*   ✅ Link to the glossary:

    ```markdown
    See our [Glossary →](#16-terminology--glossary) for key definitions.
    ```
* ✅ Define once. Then use consistently.
* 🚫 Don’t:
  * Redefine terms in every doc
  * Assume technical users already know

***

###  Formatting Rules


| Rule           | What to Follow                                                       |
| -------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Headings       | Use `## Glossary` in standalone pages                                |
| Order          | Alphabetical                                                         |
| Spelling       | Use American English (or define your variant)                        |
| Capitalization | Only capitalize proper nouns (e.g. GitHub, Node.js)                  |
| Plurals        | Use singular form as the glossary entry (e.g. `token`, not `tokens`) |

***

###  Common Anti-Patterns


| Problem                                      | Fix                                               |
| -------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| Multiple terms for the same thing            | Choose one canonical term—mark others as synonyms |
| Inconsistent capitalization (`Api` vs `API`) | Define casing rules once, follow everywhere       |
| Jargon overload                              | Add plain English versions or usage examples      |

***

###  TL;DR


* Your glossary is a contract between writer and reader
* Define once, use everywhere
* Link generously—don’t force the reader to guess
* Kill synonym drift before it kills your clarity

> Docs don’t get bloated because of too much info.\
> They get bloated because of repeated definitions.

## 17. Doc Versioning & Changelogs


_Semantic versions, last updated tags, and reader trust._

Your readers won’t always remember what they read last time—but your docs should.

Versioning and changelogs help users know:

* If the doc they’re reading is up to date
* What’s changed since the last time they followed the steps
* Whether the current instructions match their software version

***

###  Versioning Rules (Docs ≠ Product)


Use [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) (`MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`) for **published docs**, especially when they map to product releases.

| Update Type                      | Version Bump      | Example                              |
| -------------------------------- | ----------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Major rewrite or format change   | `2.0.0` → `3.0.0` | Switched from Markdown to Docusaurus |
| Added new section or feature doc | `2.0.0` → `2.1.0` | Added OAuth integration docs         |
| Typo fix, grammar, formatting    | `2.1.0` → `2.1.1` | Minor edits or phrasing updates      |

For standalone guides, you can also version **per file** in the frontmatter:

```markdown
_Last updated: May 21, 2025 • Version: 1.2.3_
```

✅ Pro tip: Don’t confuse product version with doc version—track both if needed.

***

### ️ Creating a Great CHANGELOG.md


Keep a root-level changelog that summarizes updates in **plain English** and separates additions, fixes, and changes:

✅ Good changelog format:

```markdown
## [2.1.0] – 2025-05-21

### Added

- Slack bot quickstart template
- Callout formatting section under “Tone & Voice”

### Fixed

- Broken anchor link in API setup
- Grammar issues in intro paragraphs

## [2.0.0] – 2025-04-01

### Changed

- Reorganized entire Style Guide for clarity
- Moved examples into `/examples/` folder
```

***

### ❌ Dont Do This


#### 1. ❌ Vague Commit Messages


```bash
git commit -m "update docs"
```

✅ Instead:

```bash
git commit -m "docs: clarify setup steps in quickstart guide"
```

***

#### 2. ❌ Messy Changelog


```markdown
- Fixed some stuff  
- Added docs  
- Changed things around
```

✅ Instead:

```markdown
### Fixed

- Removed duplicate command in CLI section

### Added

- New “Writing Principles” subsection with examples
```

***

#### 3. ❌ No “Last Updated” Info


```markdown
## Setup Guide


Step 1: Install the CLI...
```

✅ Instead:

```markdown
## Setup Guide  

_Last updated: May 21, 2025_
```

***

### ✅ Where to Show Versioning


| Place             | What to Show                                  |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| Top of a guide    | `_Last updated: May 21, 2025_`                |
| Footer or sidebar | Doc version (linked to changelog)             |
| In repo           | `/CHANGELOG.md` + version tags in Git history |

> Don’t just keep docs updated—show that they’re updated.

***

###  TL;DR


* Use semantic versioning when your docs follow product changes
* Maintain a clean, readable `/CHANGELOG.md`
* Always show “last updated” info in public-facing docs
* Track both technical and editorial updates
* Version commits clearly so humans—not just tools—can follow

> Code tells the computer what changed.\
> Changelogs tell the humans.

## 18. Review & Feedback Process


_How to propose, review, and merge changes without losing your mind—or your voice._

Great docs don’t just happen.\
They’re reviewed, challenged, edited, and improved—collaboratively.

This section defines how we do that:

* How to submit doc changes
* How we review with care, not ego
* How we merge with clarity and control

***

### ✍️ Submitting a Doc Change (Pull Request Etiquette)


✅ Before opening a pull request:

* Read the [Style Guide](../STYLE-GUIDE/STYLE-GUIDE.md)
* Check for existing terms in the [Glossary](./#16-terminology--glossary)
* Use meaningful commit messages
* Add a brief PR description explaining:
  * What changed
  * Why it changed
  * If any related sections were affected

#### ❌ Vague PR Description


> “Fixed some typos and stuff.”

#### ✅ Better


> “Clarified token vs. key usage in authentication section. Added alt text to 2 missing diagrams.”

***

###  How We Review


✅ We use this 4-check system:

| Review Check | Ask Yourself…                                       |
| ------------ | --------------------------------------------------- |
| ✅ Content    | Does this doc _work_ for the reader?                |
| ✅ Clarity    | Is it clear, readable, and free of jargon?          |
| ✅ Style      | Does it match our tone, structure, and voice?       |
| ✅ Structure  | Are headings, examples, and callouts used properly? |

> Bonus check: Will the _next contributor_ understand what’s happening here?

***

###  How to Give Better Feedback


| ❌ Don't Say                           | ✅ Say Instead                                             |
| ------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| “This makes no sense.”                | “Can you clarify what happens after Step 3?”              |
| “This isn’t how we usually write it.” | “Let’s align this with the 'Writing Principles' section.” |
| “Why are you even adding this?”       | “Is there a specific use case you had in mind for this?”  |

> Kindness isn’t optional—it’s part of clarity.

***

### ✅ Merging Guidelines


* Every major update needs 1+ reviewer approval
* Editorial changes (grammar, spacing, internal links) can be merged solo
* Contributors **must** tag the latest doc version and update the changelog if the structure changes
* All merges must follow conventional commit format

***

###  Pro Tips


* If a change “feels off,” suggest—not block
* If a section is unclear, ask _what it’s trying to do_, not just how it’s written
* Don’t just review the code—_review the experience_

***

###  TL;DR


* Reviews are guardrails, not gates
* Propose clearly, review kindly, and merge consistently
* Ask: “Will this make someone’s job easier?”—that’s the metric

> Good feedback doesn't just fix the doc. It teaches the writer.

***

## 19. Automation & Tooling


_Linting, CI checks, and the bots that make us better—not bitter._

Good automation doesn’t just enforce rules—it makes good writing easier.

We use light-touch automation to:

* Keep formatting and structure clean
* Prevent broken links and missing alt text
* Avoid noisy or unstructured commits
* Reduce reviewer burden on repetitive issues

***

### ⚙️ Recommended Tools


| Tool           | What It Does                                                | When We Use It             |
| -------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| `markdownlint` | Checks for heading structure, spacing, and common MD errors | On every commit            |
| `prettier`     | Formats Markdown and code blocks consistently               | Optional but recommended   |
| `alex`         | Warns about insensitive or biased language                  | Before publishing          |
| `textlint`     | Catch long sentences, passive voice, and filler words       | During reviews             |
| `husky`        | Runs checks before commit/push                              | Used with pre-commit hooks |

***

###  Example: Pre-Commit Hook with `markdownlint`


`.husky/pre-commit`

```bash
#!/bin/sh

npx markdownlint "**/*.md"
```

✅ This ensures you won’t accidentally commit a doc with broken headings or list formatting.

***

### ✅ GitHub Actions for Docs


You can also add automation to your GitHub repo with minimal overhead.

`.github/workflows/lint-docs.yml`

```yaml
name: Lint Markdown

on: [pull_request]

jobs:
  markdown-lint:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Lint Markdown
        uses: DavidAnson/markdownlint-cli2-action@v13
```

✅ This checks every PR for Markdown issues automatically.

***

###  Dont Over-Automate


#### ❌ Anti-patterns


* Blocking PRs because a line is 81 characters
* Forcing tools that contributors can’t easily install
* Adding six linters that contradict each other

#### ✅ Better Approach


* Catch _preventable friction_ (like broken anchors or missing alt text)
* Format only what matters (spacing, heading structure)
* Use automation to assist—not intimidate

***

###  What to Automate vs Review Manually


| Automate                                | Review Manually                |
| --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| Markdown syntax, broken links, alt text | Voice, tone, examples          |
| Commit style (`feat:`, `fix:`)          | Doc structure and logic        |
| Typos, spacing                          | Is this helpful to the reader? |

***

###  TL;DR


* Use `markdownlint`, `alex`, and pre-commit hooks for clarity and inclusivity
* Automate the boring stuff so humans can focus on meaning
* Don’t let bots kill creativity—use them to surface quality

> Automation should clean your docs—not erase their soul.

## 20. SEO & Discoverability


_Slugs, meta-tags, internal linking—and how to be found without selling your soul._

Your documentation is only useful if people can find it.\
Search Engine Optimization (SEO) isn’t about gaming Google—it’s about writing clearly, titling wisely, and linking meaningfully.

> Good SEO = Helping people find the right answer, right when they need it.

***

###  What Impacts Discoverability in Docs


| Element               | Why It Matters                                                         |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Headings**          | Clear, descriptive H1s and H2s improve skimming and indexing           |
| **Slugs (URLs)**      | Clean, hyphenated, keyword-rich slugs are easier to remember and share |
| **Meta Descriptions** | Appear in search snippets—summarize the doc’s usefulness in 1–2 lines  |
| **Link structure**    | Internal links build hierarchy and guide user flow                     |
| **Anchor names**      | Human-readable anchors improve link trust and click-throughs           |

***

### ✅ Writing SEO-Friendly Titles


**Bad:**

```markdown
# Features

```

**Better:**

```markdown
# Key Features of the Slack Integration

```

✅ Be specific. Use terms your audience is likely to search for.

***

###  Writing Meta Descriptions (If Your Platform Supports It)


In frontmatter or metadata blocks:

```yaml
title: "Slack Integration Setup Guide"
description: "Learn how to configure Slack integration with webhooks, auth, and error handling."
```

> ✅ Think like a user: “If I saw this in search, would I click it?”

***

###  Link Placement Best Practices


* Link **related docs inline** where context is relevant\
  ✅ _“To configure the webhook,_ [_see our error-handling guide_](webhook-errors.md)_.”_
* Avoid generic anchors like `click here`\
  ✅ _“_[_See OAuth setup instructions →_](oauth-setup.md)_”_
* Use **relative paths** for internal links (`./`, not full domain)

***

### ❌ Common SEO Pitfalls


| Mistake                          | Better Practice                                      |
| -------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| Vague titles (“Getting Started”) | “Getting Started with XYZ CLI (Beginner Guide)”      |
| Repeating exact same keywords    | Use natural variations (synonyms, question phrasing) |
| Using raw URLs                   | Use `[descriptive text](url)` instead                |
| Keyword stuffing                 | Prioritize clarity—readers > robots                  |

***

###  Tools for Smarter Docs SEO


| Tool                                                                | Use Case                              |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| [Yoast](https://yoast.com/)                                         | Write SEO-optimized meta descriptions |
| [Google Search Console](https://search.google.com/search-console)   | See what queries lead to your docs    |
| [Ahrefs Free Tools](https://ahrefs.com/webmaster-tools)             | Check backlinks and crawl health      |
| [markdown-link-check](https://github.com/tcort/markdown-link-check) | Detect broken links in `.md` files    |

***

###  TL;DR


* Title with clarity, not cleverness
* Write 1–2 sentence summaries (meta descriptions)
* Use anchor links with purpose—not just out of habit
* Avoid stuffing keywords; favor discoverability through usefulness
* Think “search phrases,” not buzzwords

> Search engines don’t rank what’s beautiful.\
> They rank what’s useful—and readable.

***

## 21. Living Documentation


_Review schedules, ownership, and docs that age gracefully._

Docs are not code—but they _do decay_.

This section helps you keep your documentation relevant, helpful, and trusted—without burning out your team.

A “living” document means:

* It reflects the current state of the product
* It has an owner, not just a creator
* It signals when it’s outdated or ready for removal

***

###  Signs Your Doc Is Dying


| Symptom                                     | What It Means                          |
| ------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Reader feedback is unclear or contradictory | The doc is outdated or confusing       |
| Internal links are broken                   | Sections have moved or been renamed    |
| Screenshots show an old UI                  | The product evolved but the doc didn’t |
| It only made sense during a sprint          | The doc has lost long-term context     |

***

### ✅ Review Cadence Suggestions


| Doc Type                 | Review Every…                        |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------ |
| Core product docs        | 3–6 months                           |
| Integrations / APIs      | Quarterly or per release             |
| Internal onboarding docs | Twice a year                         |
| Style Guide              | Living edits, with quarterly reviews |

> If it impacts users, review it like a product.

***

### ‍ Assigning Ownership


Every major doc should have:

* A **primary maintainer** (can be shared across teams)
* A clear history of contributors (visible via commits or metadata)
* A changelog or “last updated” tag to guide readers and editors

```markdown
_Last reviewed: April 2025 by @devdocqueen_
```

***

###  How to Retire a Doc (Gracefully)


Don’t just delete it. Deprecate with dignity.

✅ Steps:

1.  Add a banner to the top of the doc:

    ```markdown
    > ⚠️ **Deprecated:** This guide is outdated as of April 2024.  
    > For the latest setup, [see the updated OAuth guide](./oauth-v2.md).
    ```
2. Move to `/archive/` or clearly label with `[DEPRECATED]` in the filename
3. Remove it from nav menus and TOC if it's not actively needed

***

###  Proactive Doc Maintenance Checklist


| Task                                  | Frequency    |
| ------------------------------------- | ------------ |
| Check for broken links or 404s        | Monthly      |
| Refresh screenshots and code examples | Quarterly    |
| Validate internal links still resolve | Monthly      |
| Ask users what’s unclear or missing   | Continuously |

***

### ❌ What Not to Do


| Mistake                      | Better Approach                                      |
| ---------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| Assume published = finished  | Review regularly; treat like product assets          |
| Delete docs without redirect | Deprecate visibly or archive with links              |
| Ignore reader feedback       | Add clarifications or open a PR—even for small notes |

***

###  TL;DR


* Assign doc owners and review cycles—don’t let docs drift
* Mark outdated guides with version labels or warnings
* Archive responsibly, and always point readers to what’s next
* Keep changelogs and last-reviewed metadata visible

> Living docs aren’t constantly changing.\
> They’re just never ignored.

***

## 22. AI-Assisted Writing


_Guidance on responsible, ethical, and effective use of AI in docs._

AI can draft, polish, rephrase, reformat—and hallucinate.

This section helps you use AI as a writing assistant—not a ghostwriter—and ensures your documentation stays:

* Clear
* Credible
* Human-first

***

###  What AI Can Help With


| Task                   | AI Is Useful For…                                  |
| ---------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| Rephrasing text        | Making long paragraphs clearer or shorter          |
| Formatting Markdown    | Cleaning up tables, lists, headings                |
| Generating boilerplate | Drafting TOCs, changelogs, or style guide stubs    |
| Translating tone       | Converting corporate speak to plain English        |
| Brainstorming examples | Coming up with analogies, metaphors, or edge cases |

***

### ❌ What AI Should NOT Do


| Task                               | Why It’s Risky                                 |
| ---------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Write final technical instructions | May hallucinate commands or concepts           |
| Generate real code snippets        | Can suggest insecure, untested, or broken code |
| Mimic company voice                | Often sounds generic or fake “helpful”         |
| Fabricate citations or links       | Breaks trust immediately                       |
| Replace writer ownership           | Undermines author intent, empathy, and context |

***

###  Ethical Considerations


| Principle                | What It Means                                                            |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Transparency**         | If AI drafted part of a doc, reviewers should know                       |
| **Human accountability** | Every doc must have a human editor and owner                             |
| **No silent generation** | Don’t paste AI-generated content without reviewing every word            |
| **No plagiarism**        | Never lift examples or phrasing from other sources via AI without credit |
| **No fake examples**     | Real screenshots, real workflows, or clearly marked demos only           |

> ✍️ Writers write.\
> AI assists—but humans are responsible.

***

### ✅ Ethical AI Workflow


1. **Prompt clearly**\
   &#xNAN;_“Rewrite this section for a beginner. Avoid jargon, but don’t lose technical meaning.”_
2. **Edit ruthlessly**\
   &#xNAN;_&#x49;f it’s bland, bloated, or incorrect—cut it._
3. **Verify everything**\
   &#xNAN;_&#x43;heck commands, URLs, syntax, formatting, tone._
4. **Mark what’s incomplete**\
   &#xNAN;_&#x41;dd `[INSERT real screenshot of new UI here]` or `[Placeholder: list common error codes]`._

***

###  Prompt Design: Good vs Bad


Writing for AI is a skill. Here’s how to level up:

#### ❌ Bad Prompt:


> “Write API documentation for my product.”

❌ What you get:

* Hallucinated endpoints
* Placeholder tokens
* Random headers and features you don’t support
* Generic tone with no context

***

#### ✅ Better Prompt:


> “Write a short Getting Started section for a REST API with three endpoints: `/login`, `/logout`, and `/profile`. Focus on tone clarity over cleverness. Audience is mid-level devs familiar with Postman.”

✅ What you get:

* Role-aware, usable draft
* Structure and examples tailored to real devs
* Something you can edit, not trash

***

#### ❌ Bad Prompt:


> “Explain JSON to a non-techie.”

❌ What you get:

> “JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation and is a lightweight data-interchange format. It is easy to read and write…”

✅ Zzzzz...

***

#### ✅ Better Prompt:


> “Explain JSON to a non-technical HR manager who understands spreadsheets. Use a friendly tone. Compare it to a table of columns and rows.”

✅ What you get:

> “Imagine a spreadsheet where each row is an employee, and each column—like name, title, and ID—is a data label. JSON is just that, but for machines to read and pass around.”

Now that’s **readable and reusable**.

***

### ⚠️ Common Pitfalls with AI-Written Docs


| Mistake                   | Real Impact                                 |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| Copying without editing   | Leads to errors, bloated text, robotic tone |
| Using fake file paths     | Users get confused or break things          |
| Not attributing AI output | Breaks trust and ownership                  |
| Skipping fact-checking    | Introduces silent bugs or false features    |

***

### ✅ Good AI Use vs Bad AI Use


#### ✅ Good:


```markdown
> AI-generated: Drafted alt text for all diagrams.  
> Human-edited: Shortened, clarified, and removed 2 inaccurate suggestions.  
> Final: Added context-specific screenshots and corrected link targets.
```

#### ❌ Bad:


```markdown
> AI-generated: Wrote entire user guide.  
> Human: Copied and pasted into main without review.  
> Result: Broken commands, fake endpoints, inconsistent tone.
```

***

###  TL;DR


* Use AI to support—not replace—your writing
* Disclose, review, and rewrite as needed
* Write better prompts, and treat AI like an intern—not a savior
* If it sounds fake, bloated, or risky—it probably is

> AI can accelerate writing.\
> But only humans can write with **intent, empathy, and truth**.

***

## 23. Multi-Format Output


_PDF, slides, video scripts—and writing that works everywhere._

Your documentation may need to live beyond Markdown.

This section helps you write with adaptability in mind—so your content can move between:

* Slideshows
* Tutorials or videos
* Voice-over scripts
* Interactive tools
* PDFs or printed booklets

> Great documentation isn’t tied to its format.\
> It’s built on clarity, rhythm, and hierarchy.

***

###  Format-Agnostic Writing Principles


| Rule                                 | Why It Matters                                   |
| ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------ |
| Use clear headings                   | Can be reused as slide titles or section markers |
| Short paragraphs                     | Easier to voice-over or present visually         |
| Avoid inline-only instructions       | Screen readers or slides won’t show hover states |
| Separate content from visuals        | Easier to reuse content across formats           |
| Use consistent callouts and examples | Helps in script narration or alt-text captions   |

***

###  Adapting a Doc to Other Formats


#### ✅ Slide Deck (Presentation)


| Doc Element  | Slide Equivalent                  |
| ------------ | --------------------------------- |
| `## Heading` | Slide title                       |
| Bullet list  | Slide bullets                     |
| Code block   | Screenshot or side-by-side        |
| Callout box  | Presenter note or visual emphasis |

#### ✅ Video Tutorial or Script


| Doc Element       | Spoken Equivalent         |
| ----------------- | ------------------------- |
| Step-by-step list | Walkthrough narration     |
| Notes or tips     | On-screen annotations     |
| Visual references | Camera zooms / highlights |
| Examples          | Demo clips or animations  |

***

###  Multi-Format Layout Template


```markdown
## Section Title  

_1-sentence intro for context_

### Step-by-step / Concept  

- Step 1: Do the thing  
- Step 2: Verify it worked  
- Step 3: Roll back if needed

> 💡 Tip: Use `--dry-run` before applying live changes.

### ❌ Pitfalls to Avoid


| Problem                              | Fix                                                  |
| ------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| Long, dense paragraphs               | Break into 2–3 line chunks                           |
| Reliance on layout-specific features | Avoid columns, hover text, or interactive-only notes |
| Visuals with no description          | Add alt-text or captions                             |
| Repetitive formatting across formats | Keep one clean source and generate outputs as needed |

***

###  Tools to Export From Markdown


| Tool                                                      | Output                           | Notes                                    |
| --------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org)                              | PDF, DOCX, slides                | Great for automation                     |
| [Marp](https://marp.app)                                  | Slides                           | Turn Markdown into PowerPoint-like decks |
| [Docsify](https://docsify.js.org/)                        | Web docs                         | Live preview-friendly                    |
| [Lunacy + Figma Plugins](https://www.figma.com/community) | Graphics/slides from doc layouts | For visual-first teams                   |

***

###  TL;DR


* Write with format flexibility in mind—structure > style
* Keep language concise and modular for reuse in slides, videos, scripts, and more
* Separate content from layout, always add alt text
* Use tools to export—not rewrite

> A well-written doc should be easy to **read**, easy to **present**, and easy to **teach**.

***

## 24. Evolution Rules


_How and when this guide updates—because writing standards grow, too._

Style guides aren’t holy texts.\
They’re living agreements—meant to evolve with your team, your audience, and your tools.

This section defines how we:

* Propose changes to the guide
* Decide what gets added, rejected, or rewritten
* Keep the guide relevant without constant churn

***

###  When Should the Style Guide Change?


✅ Add or revise a section when:

* There’s **repeated confusion** across docs or contributors
* A new format or tool (e.g. AI, localization, video) becomes common
* You’ve spotted **outdated guidance or broken rules**
* Feedback or onboarding shows friction

✅ Avoid changes just because:

* It’s “how you personally like to write”
* You want to make a sentence sound cooler
* You’re trying to match external brands or trends

> This guide evolves for the **collective clarity**—not individual voice.

***

###  How to Propose a Change


Every style edit—no matter how small—should:

* Be submitted as a Pull Request
* Include a short rationale in the PR description
* Reference an example of where the current rule caused confusion or inconsistency

#### ✅ Example PR Description:


```markdown
This PR suggests rewording the “Emphasis Rules” section to better distinguish between emphasis for emotion vs. technical commands. 

We noticed contributors overusing `**bold**` where italics were meant to soften tone.

Issue raised in #42 and #51.
```

***

###  Who Approves Changes?


| Change Type                             | Reviewer Required                      |
| --------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Minor copy tweaks or typo fixes         | 1 contributor or editor                |
| New rule, term, or section              | Style guide lead or majority agreement |
| Structural changes to hierarchy or tone | Needs team discussion & review         |

✅ Use GitHub Discussions or issues for large proposals before writing a PR.

***

### ️ Versioning the Style Guide


The style guide has its own semantic version.

```markdown
🎨 Style Guide — Version 1.2.0  
_Last updated: May 21, 2025_
```

| Version Type | What Changed                             |
| ------------ | ---------------------------------------- |
| `x.0.0`      | Major rewrite or tone change             |
| `0.x.0`      | Added sections, rules, or glossary terms |
| `0.0.x`      | Fixes, rewording, formatting cleanup     |

***

###  What Doesnt Change Easily


Some sections require higher scrutiny before edits:

* Tone & Voice
* Glossary Definitions
* Accessibility Rules
* Ethical/AI Usage Standards

> These are foundational.\
> Updates should reflect real-world pain—not personal taste.

***

###  TL;DR


* Style guides are agreements, not absolutes
* Propose changes with examples, not opinions
* Version the guide, track the changes, and explain the _why_
* Change what serves the reader—not what flatters the writer

> This guide evolves—but only for the right reasons.
