## Automation Workflow Overview
- Explains how documentation is built and deployed automatically after every merge.

## Importance & CI/CD Benefits
- Continuous publishing ensures the latest changes are visible without manual steps.

## Target Audience (DevOps, Developers)
- Release managers and documentation maintainers.

## Environment & Prerequisites
- Write access to the deployment branch and secrets for target hosting.

## Security & Compliance in Automation
- Verify that only sanitized artifacts are deployed. Audit logs for every publish action.

## Step-by-Step Automation Tasks
1. Trigger on merges to the main branch.
2. Build static site assets.
3. Deploy artifacts to the configured hosting service.

## Explicit Workflow Examples & Templates
```yaml

    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
```

## Known Automation Issues & Mitigation
- Misconfigured credentials can stop deployments; use environment secrets and rotate them regularly.

## Automation Best Practices
- Keep build steps minimal to shorten pipeline duration.

## Troubleshooting Automation
- Review deployment logs on the hosting platform when pages fail to update.

## Dependencies & Escalation
- Escalate hosting errors to the DevOps team or infrastructure support.

## Automation Success Metrics & Outcomes
- Reduced manual release work and more frequent documentation updates.

## Resources & Tooling References
