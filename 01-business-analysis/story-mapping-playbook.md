# Story Mapping Playbook

---

## Overview

Story mapping visualizes how users interact with your product by laying out tasks in the order they’re performed. It helps teams align features to real user goals, prioritize delivery slices, and identify gaps in functionality.

This playbook introduces a practical approach to building story maps, from identifying user outcomes to sequencing releases and managing dependencies.

---

## Why It Matters

Without story mapping:

- Backlogs become flat lists that lack narrative or hierarchy  
- Features are scoped in isolation without user context  
- Releases ship incomplete experiences  

With story mapping:

- Teams visualize real-world usage flow  
- Product managers group features by user value, not just feasibility  
- Development can slice across workflows meaningfully (MVP-first, experience later)  

It turns delivery into a story, not a spec dump.

---

## Audience, Scope & Personas

### Audience

- Product Owners  
- Business Analysts  
- UX Designers  
- Agile Coaches  
- Developers involved in backlog grooming  

### Scope

Story mapping is used in:

- Product discovery  
- Sprint and release planning  
- MVP scoping  
- Post-MVP experience enhancement mapping  

It complements epics, user stories, and release boards.

---

## Prerequisites

- ✅ Defined personas and user roles  
- ✅ Key user goals or outcomes identified  
- ✅ Existing backlog or product vision  
- ✅ Collaboration tool (e.g., Miro, Mural, FigJam, whiteboard)  
- ✅ Stakeholder participation (PO, UX, Dev Lead)

---

## Security, Compliance & Privacy

- Do not include real customer data in maps  
- Mask sensitive flows (e.g., payment gateways, login data)  
- Store story maps in access-controlled folders or boards  
- Mark internal-only diagrams with appropriate classification labels  
- If using cloud-based tools, confirm data retention and privacy policies

---

## Tasks & Step-by-Step Instructions

### 1. Identify the User Journey

- Write out the key **tasks** a user performs from start to finish  
- Group these as high-level **activities** or **goals** (e.g., "Browse", "Purchase", "Track Order")  
- This becomes the **top row** of your map

### 2. Break Tasks into User Stories

- Beneath each activity, list smaller stories or steps  
- Use story templates (e.g., “As a user, I want…”)  
- These become **narrative blocks** in the middle of your map

### 3. Prioritize Horizontally

- For each activity, rank stories top to bottom based on necessity  
- The **top row** under each activity = must-have for MVP  
- Lower rows = enhancements, edge cases, post-MVP items

### 4. Slice into Releases

- Draw horizontal lines to group stories into **releases**  
- First release = end-to-end usable product (not just pieces)  
- Each release should complete at least one meaningful user goal

### 5. Review, Revise, Refactor

- Walk through the map with the team  
- Check for duplicate, missing, or unclear stories  
- Link stories to epics or backlog IDs  
- Export or snapshot final map for planning reference

## Access Control & Permissions (RBAC guidelines)

| Role           | Access Type       | Justification                               |
|----------------|-------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| Product Owner  | Full Edit         | Map owner and backlog manager                |
| Business Analyst | Co-edit + Comment | Clarify flows, facilitate sessions           |
| Developers     | View + Suggest    | Estimate and sequence feasible slices        |
| UX Designers   | Edit + Visual Layer | Integrate journey maps and UX flows         |
| Scrum Master   | Comment + Flag    | Align with sprint planning hygiene           |

---

## Practical Examples & Templates (✅/❌)

### ✅ MVP-focused Story Slice

**Activity**: “Purchase Product”  

- As a guest user, I want to add an item to cart  
- As a guest, I want to checkout using a single payment method  
- As a user, I want to receive an order confirmation

✅ Slice = Minimal flow from add-to-cart → payment → confirmation

---

### ❌ Flat Story Dump

> “Add cart”, “Add wishlist”, “Edit address”, “Sort products”, “Rate item”...

❌ Problem: No story flow, priorities unclear, no user context

---

## Known Issues & Friction Points

| Issue                        | Impact                         | Suggested Fix                         |
|-----------------------------|--------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Too granular too early      | Fatigue, confusion              | Start with high-level activities first |
| Features without stories     | Missing implementation context | Break epics into map-worthy slices     |
| No journey thread            | Incomplete user experience      | Map entire workflow, not isolated tasks|
| Feature-first mindset        | Ignores user outcomes           | Begin with goals, not functions        |

---

## Tips & Best Practices

### ✅ Do

- Use sticky notes or card colors to represent story types (core, enhancement, tech-debt)  
- Involve the full team—stories improve when multiple perspectives combine  
- Keep stories visible throughout the sprint  
- Export and version your map  
- Use swimlanes for personas if needed

### ❌ Don’t

- Focus only on UI features—include backend and integration work  
- Over-document in the map—link stories to Jira for detail  
- Treat the map as static—update it post-retrospectives

## Troubleshooting Guidance

| Symptom                    | Cause                                | Resolution                              |
|----------------------------|----------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| "MVP isn’t clear"          | No slice logic                        | Redraw map with prioritized release cuts |
| "We missed a step"         | Journey incomplete                    | Replay end-to-end user flow with UX team |
| "Too many stories"         | Over-scoping without filters          | Collapse enhancements into later releases|
| "Stories don’t align"      | Parallel workstreams not mapped       | Merge swimlanes or unify user goal paths |

## Dependencies, Risks & Escalation Path

### Dependencies

| Dependency         | Description                                  |
|--------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| Persona Profiles   | Anchors user journeys and needs              |
| Product Vision     | Helps define what’s in vs. out of MVP        |
| Technical Feasibility Review | Ensures prioritized stories are viable |

### Risks

| Risk                           | Mitigation                                |
|--------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| Mapping done without dev/UX    | Stories become non-implementable           |
| No story-to-epic linkage       | Poor backlog tracking                      |
| Outdated maps post-sprint      | Set review checkpoints every 2 weeks       |
