# User Story Templates

## Overview
Standardized user story formats help teams capture feature requirements from a user's perspective.

## Why It Matters
Consistent stories clarify priorities and enable developers to estimate and deliver efficiently.

## Audience, Scope & Personas
Product owners, business analysts, and sprint teams can tailor these templates for agile planning.

## Prerequisites
Stakeholders should agree on the definition of "done" and story acceptance criteria.

## Security & Compliance
Avoid storing personal data within example stories. Reference any compliance requirements that shape acceptance criteria.

## Tasks & Step-by-Step Instructions
1. Write the user role, goal, and benefit.
2. Add acceptance criteria in bullet points.
3. Review with the team for clarity and feasibility.

## Access Control & Permissions
Share templates in a central repository with read access for contributors and edit rights for product owners.

## Examples & Templates
✅ "As a customer, I want to reset my password so I can access my account."
❌ Include technical implementation details in the user story.

## Known Issues & Friction Points
Stories can become too granular or vague. Keep them small but meaningful and link related stories when needed.

## Tips & Best Practices
Limit each story to a single outcome and define clear acceptance criteria.

## Troubleshooting
If a story is too broad, break it down into smaller, testable increments.

## Dependencies & Escalation
Consult UX and development leads if stories conflict with existing architecture or design.

## Success Metrics & Outcomes
A backlog of well-formed stories that pass peer review and allow precise estimation.
