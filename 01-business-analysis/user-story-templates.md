# User Story Templates

---

## Overview

User stories are the foundational building blocks of agile delivery. This reference provides standardized templates and practices to help teams write effective, actionable stories from a user perspective—ensuring alignment between business intent and technical implementation.

---

## Why It Matters

Clear, consistent user stories reduce ambiguity and accelerate delivery. They help:

- Align stakeholders on intent, scope, and outcomes  
- Guide developers toward testable, valuable features  
- Enable backlog prioritization and estimation  
- Improve sprint velocity and reduce rework  

Bad stories lead to misaligned features. Great stories lead to business value.

---

## Audience, Scope & Personas

### Audience

- Product Owners  
- Business Analysts  
- Agile Coaches  
- Sprint Teams  
- UX/Design Collaborators  

### Scope

This reference applies to feature requests, enhancement planning, backlog grooming, and sprint scoping sessions. It is platform-agnostic and adaptable for tools like Jira, Azure Boards, or Trello.

---

## Prerequisites

- ✅ Stakeholders aligned on “Definition of Done”  
- ✅ Acceptance criteria format agreed upon (Given-When-Then, checklist, etc.)  
- ✅ UX input, where applicable  
- ✅ Product vision or feature epic to anchor the story  

---

## Security, Compliance & Privacy

- Avoid including real personal data in user story examples  
- Use anonymized roles (e.g., “user”, “admin”, “analyst”)  
- Reference relevant compliance guidelines (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA) in acceptance criteria if needed  
- Store finalized stories in systems with access controls (Jira, Confluence, etc.)

---

## Tasks & Step-by-Step Instructions

### 1. Write the User Story

Use the standard format:

```markdown
As a [role],  
I want to [action/goal],  
So that [desired outcome].
```

Example:

```markdown
As a system administrator,  
I want to set role-based access controls,  
So that only authorized users can access sensitive data.
```

### 2. Define Acceptance Criteria

Use bullet points or behavior-driven format:

- ✅ User can select roles from a dropdown
- ✅ Unauthorized access attempts are logged
- ✅ System restricts views based on assigned roles

Or use Gherkin-style:

```gherkin
Given a user with "Viewer" role  
When they access the admin panel  
Then they see an "Access Denied" message
```

### 3. Review with Team

- Confirm clarity, feasibility, and testability
- Link to design mocks, user flows, or relevant documentation
- Update based on team feedback before marking ready-for-dev

## Access Control & Permissions

| Role          | Access Type    | Justification                          |
| ------------- | -------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Product Owner | Full Edit      | Story ownership and backlog management |
| Analyst       | Draft + Review | Capture inputs from stakeholders       |
| Developer     | Read + Comment | Confirm technical feasibility          |
| QA/Tester     | Read-only      | Use stories to build test cases        |
| Scrum Master  | Review + Flag  | Ensure story hygiene and readiness     |

---

## Practical Examples & Templates (✅/❌)

### ✅ Strong User Stories

```markdown
As a customer,  
I want to reset my password,  
So that I can regain account access securely.
```

**Acceptance Criteria**

- User receives a reset email within 2 minutes
- Link expires after 24 hours
- Must include captcha to prevent abuse

---

### ❌ Poor User Stories

> “Add a reset password API.”
> *Problem: No user, no benefit, unclear success condition.*

## Known Issues & Friction Points

| Problem                     | Impact                         | Suggested Fix                             |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------- |
| Too vague                   | Misunderstood developer output | Add real-world context or user role       |
| Overly technical language   | Misalignment with business     | Rewrite in user terms, not implementation |
| Missing acceptance criteria | Hard to test or validate       | Add bullet list or Gherkin examples       |
| Duplicate or conflicting    | Prioritization problems        | Consolidate under epics or themes         |

---

## Tips & Best Practices

### ✅ Do

- Focus on one action per story
- Use real roles (not "the system")
- Validate acceptance criteria with QA
- Link to mockups or data models if needed
- Keep language accessible—avoid jargon

### ❌ Don’t

- Include backend-only requirements here (track in technical tasks)
- Write stories that bundle multiple outcomes
- Use unclear verbs like “improve,” “optimize,” “support”
- Skip user benefit or business value

## Troubleshooting Guidance

| Symptom                             | Likely Cause                      | Action                                  |
| ----------------------------------- | --------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| “The story is too big for a sprint” | Spanning multiple actions         | Break into subtasks or related stories  |
| “Team interprets it differently”    | Ambiguous language or no examples | Add visuals or behavioral test cases    |
| “Nothing is testable”               | No acceptance criteria            | Add measurable success conditions       |
| “Stakeholders aren’t aligned”       | Missed validation round           | Review story in sprint planning session |
