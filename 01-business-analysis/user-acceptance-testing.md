# User Acceptance Testing (UAT) Guide

---

## Overview

User Acceptance Testing (UAT) is the final validation phase before go-live, where real users verify that the solution meets business needs. This guide helps cross-functional teams plan, execute, and document UAT with precision—ensuring that product releases align with expectations, regulations, and operational readiness.

---

## Why It Matters

Skipping UAT or running it poorly leads to:

- Undetected business-critical issues in production  
- Stakeholder dissatisfaction and trust erosion  
- Rework cycles that delay deployment or increase cost  

Proper UAT ensures:

- Real-world usage validation  
- Accurate reflection of workflows  
- Business signoff based on evidence, not assumption  

It is not just a testing phase—it’s business approval with consequences.

---

## Audience, Scope & Personas

### Audience

- Business Analysts  
- Product Owners & Managers  
- UAT Coordinators & Test Leads  
- Functional Users / End-Users  
- QA & Release Teams

### Scope

Applies to:

- Feature releases, major enhancements  
- Workflow or system configuration changes  
- Platform migrations or vendor rollouts  
- Internal tools and regulated applications  

Not meant for: load testing, performance tuning, or deep technical QA.

---

## Prerequisites

- ✅ Functional testing passed (QA signoff)  
- ✅ Requirements & acceptance criteria finalized  
- ✅ Test cases reviewed and mapped to features  
- ✅ Test environment mirrors production  
- ✅ UAT participants identified and onboarded  
- ✅ Defect triage process agreed upon  

---

## Security, Privacy & Compliance

- Ensure UAT is conducted in a **secured, isolated environment**  
- Mask or anonymize sensitive production data  
- Apply **role-based access (RBAC)** to simulate real-user permissions  
- Document any compliance checks as part of UAT (e.g., GDPR workflows)  
- Store signed UAT reports and logs in auditable repositories  
- Use secure communication for defect and feedback submissions  

---

## Tasks & Step-by-Step Instructions

### 1. Plan the UAT

- Define UAT entry/exit criteria  
- Identify UAT testers and assign user roles  
- Schedule kickoff and training for testers  
- Share UAT scripts, test data, and expected outcomes

### 2. Execute the Tests

- Testers follow scripts and log outcomes  
- Note defects, unexpected results, usability issues  
- Capture screenshots or recordings where helpful  
- Maintain logs with timestamps, steps taken, and result status

### 3. Triage and Retest

- Review defects with Dev/QA for resolution  
- Retest failed scenarios after fixes  
- Confirm resolution with original tester  
- Maintain change log and impact notes

### 4. Final Sign-Off

- Collect feedback from testers and stakeholders  
- Prepare UAT Summary Report  
- Obtain written signoff (manual or electronic)  
- Archive test artifacts for audit readiness

## Access Control & Permissions (RBAC guidelines)

| Role              | Access Level          | Justification                                  |
|-------------------|------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| Test Coordinator  | Full admin             | Sets up scripts, assigns users, triages bugs   |
| UAT Tester        | Limited edit           | Executes tests and logs outcomes               |
| QA Engineer       | View + support         | Monitors execution, maps to functional tests   |
| Business Owner    | Comment + signoff      | Reviews results, signs off                     |
| Dev Lead          | Read + fix assignment  | Reviews defects and feedback                   |

## Practical Examples & Templates (✅/❌)

### ✅ UAT Test Case Template

```markdown
Test Case ID: UAT-014  
Title: Verify Invoice Approval Flow  
Precondition: Logged in as Finance Admin  
Steps:  
1. Navigate to Invoices  
2. Select unpaid invoice  
3. Click Approve  

Expected Result:  
Invoice status changes to “Approved”; confirmation message appears.

Status: ✅ Pass  
Tester: @ashwin.finance
```

### ❌ Bad Example

> "Try invoice flow"
> *Too vague. Missing steps, roles, expected behavior, and outcome.*

## Known Issues & Friction Points

| Problem                   | Impact                         | Suggested Fix                          |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------ | -------------------------------------- |
| Untrained testers         | Invalid results, skipped steps | Run UAT onboarding & walkthroughs      |
| Missing test data         | Blocked execution              | Prepare test data in advance           |
| Ambiguous test scripts    | Tester confusion               | Use plain language with screenshots    |
| Delayed defect resolution | Retest bottlenecks             | Allocate dev bandwidth during UAT week |

---

## Tips & Best Practices

### ✅ Do

- Use spreadsheets or UAT tools like TestRail or Zephyr
- Assign owners for each test case
- Tag defects with severity and feature module
- Record feedback that’s not a bug (usability suggestions)
- Conduct daily syncs to track progress and unblock testers

### ❌ Don’t

- Use production environment for UAT
- Let testers “figure it out”—provide scripts
- Skip sign-off due to time pressure
- Log bugs in chat tools—use issue trackers

## Troubleshooting Guidance

| Symptom                            | Root Cause                          | Resolution                             |
| ---------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| “Testers didn’t finish all cases”  | Too many cases, unclear priorities  | Prioritize by business-critical flows  |
| “No one logged defects”            | Confusion about process             | Use simple defect template or tracker  |
| “Stakeholders reject release late” | Poor communication or late feedback | Engage stakeholders in UAT walkthrough |
| “UAT logs are missing”             | Ad-hoc tracking                     | Mandate structured test reporting      |
