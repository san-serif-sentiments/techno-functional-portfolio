# 01-Business Analysis: Requirements, Process Discovery & Strategic Alignment

---

## Overview

This document defines the foundational responsibilities and methods used in business analysis. It outlines a structured approach for gathering requirements, analyzing workflows, translating business needs into functional documentation, and enabling stakeholder clarity across product, operations, and engineering teams.

---

## Why It Matters

Business analysis acts as the connective tissue between vision and execution. Without clearly defined requirements, expectations often diverge between business and technical teams, leading to:

- Feature creep and scope misalignment  
- Miscommunication during handovers  
- Missed opportunities and inefficient resource use  
- Poor user adoption or delivery failure  

Effective business analysis bridges this gap by ensuring stakeholders **know what they want**, **agree on why they want it**, and **document how it should behave**.

---

## Audience, Scope & Personas

### Audience

- Business Analysts  
- Product Owners and Project Sponsors  
- Functional Consultants  
- Solution Architects  
- Change Management Teams

### Scope

This document applies to business analysis practices for:

- Enterprise systems (CRM, ERP, HRMS)  
- Digital product teams  
- Operational improvement programs  
- Cross-functional project discovery  

Not in scope: Legal contract interpretation, security audits, or standalone QA efforts.

---

## Prerequisites

Before initiating business analysis tasks:

- ✅ Clear project brief or executive mandate  
- ✅ Access to existing system/process documentation  
- ✅ Availability of key stakeholders for interviews/workshops  
- ✅ Project scope and timelines approved  
- ✅ Compliance clearance to review user data if applicable  
- ✅ Standardized documentation templates available

---

## Security, Compliance & Privacy

- Always follow **least privilege access** when reviewing internal tools or datasets  
- If analyzing systems with personal data, ensure anonymization or pseudonymization  
- Follow your company’s privacy standards and data classification policies (e.g., ISO 27001, GDPR)  
- Never record stakeholder conversations without explicit permission  
- Store analysis artifacts in secure, access-controlled folders with versioning

---

## Tasks & Step-by-Step Instructions

### 1. Stakeholder Discovery

- Identify all affected teams and contributors  
- Schedule 1:1s, group interviews, or discovery workshops  
- Document roles, responsibilities, and pain points  

### 2. Process Mapping

- Capture current-state workflows (AS-IS)  
- Use visual tools (e.g., BPMN, Lucidchart, Miro)  
- Validate process maps with stakeholders for accuracy  

### 3. Requirements Gathering

- Break down needs into functional and non-functional categories  
- Use structured techniques like MoSCoW, user stories, or acceptance criteria  
- Prioritize based on impact, urgency, and effort  

### 4. Gap Analysis

- Compare AS-IS with desired future state (TO-BE)  
- Highlight blockers, inefficiencies, or missing system capabilities  

### 5. Documentation & Handoff

- Convert findings into structured artifacts:
  - Business Requirements Document (BRD)  
  - Functional Specification Document (FSD)  
  - User Stories with Acceptance Criteria  
- Conduct formal walkthroughs with tech and product teams  
- Maintain traceability matrix for version control

## Access Control & Permissions (RBAC guidelines)

| Role                | Access Type           | Purpose                                   |
|---------------------|------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| Business Analyst    | Edit + full access     | Lead documentation and stakeholder mapping |
| Project Sponsor     | Review + approve       | Validate scope and alignment              |
| Engineering Lead    | Review + comment       | Translate into system behavior            |
| QA/Testing Team     | Read-only              | Use requirements for test case design     |
| Compliance Officer  | Review only            | Ensure sensitive data protocols are followed |

---

## Practical Examples & Templates (✅/❌)

### ✅ Good Example: User Story with Context

```markdown
As a hiring manager,  
I want to receive alerts when candidate documents are incomplete,  
So that I can take immediate action and reduce onboarding delays.
````

### ❌ Bad Example: Vague Requirement

> “Improve the recruitment process.”
> *No clarity, no actionability, no context.*

## Known Issues & Friction Points

| Challenge                  | Impact                              | Fix/Prevention                         |
| -------------------------- | ----------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Stakeholder unavailability | Incomplete or biased requirements   | Use async forms, escalate via sponsors |
| Scope creep                | Project delays, shifting priorities | Freeze baseline after signoff          |
| Process undocumented       | Rework or poor assumptions          | Use observation and shadowing sessions |
| Misuse of jargon           | Misinterpretation by dev/QA teams   | Translate into user-centric phrasing   |

---

## Tips & Best Practices

### ✅ Do

* Visualize workflows wherever possible
* Use structured frameworks (e.g., SIPOC, SWOT, 5 Whys)
* Validate findings iteratively with stakeholders
* Maintain a glossary of recurring terms

### ❌ Don’t

* Assume stakeholder clarity on business goals
* Use technical language in business-facing docs
* Delay signoffs indefinitely—set validation timelines
* Skip user-facing validation before documentation handoff

## Troubleshooting Guidance

| Symptom                            | Root Cause                            | Suggested Action                            |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| "I never said that was a priority" | Lack of documented stakeholder inputs | Share initial interview transcript/log      |
| "That’s not how the process works" | Misunderstood workflows               | Reconfirm with frontline operators          |
| "We can’t build that feature"      | Tech limitation not surfaced early    | Loop in engineering earlier                 |
| "We already solved this last year" | Redundant documentation               | Review historical tickets or knowledge base |
