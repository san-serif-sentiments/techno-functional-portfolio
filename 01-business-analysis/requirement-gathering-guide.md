# Requirement Gathering Guide

---

## Overview

This document provides a structured method for gathering project requirements that reflect stakeholder intent, align with business goals, and reduce downstream miscommunication. It includes step-by-step tasks, validation techniques, and real-world examples to guide business analysts, product owners, and cross-functional teams through a repeatable, compliant process.

---

## Why It Matters

Poorly gathered requirements lead to costly delays, misunderstood features, and broken trust. A consistent requirement gathering process ensures:

- Shared understanding between technical and business teams  
- Traceable decision-making from goal to feature  
- Reduced scope creep and rework  
- Strong foundations for planning, estimation, and design  

Capturing the “why” behind every “what” is essential for building solutions that matter.

## Audience, Scope & Personas

### Audience

- Business Analysts  
- Product Owners  
- System Architects  
- Project Managers  

### Key Stakeholders

- **Project Sponsors** – define scope, sign off on funding  
- **Business Owners** – articulate strategic goals  
- **End Users** – highlight pain points and feature gaps  
- **Technical Leads** – translate requirements into system behavior  
- **Compliance/Security** – validate alignment with standards and policies  

### Scope

This guide applies to internal enterprise projects, digital initiatives, and stakeholder-driven platform enhancements. It does not cover contractual RFPs or external client-facing feature scoping.

---

## Prerequisites

- ✅ Approved project charter with defined scope  
- ✅ Stakeholder list with contact roles  
- ✅ Existing process maps, system diagrams, or past documentation  
- ✅ Agreed elicitation methods (interview, workshop, survey)  
- ✅ Draft business goals with measurable intent  
- ✅ Access to secure documentation tools (Confluence, Notion, etc.)

---

## Security, Compliance & Privacy

- Store raw notes and recordings in access-controlled locations  
- Use encrypted channels for sharing documents  
- Follow GDPR/PII guidelines when collecting sensitive data  
- Include disclaimers on draft documents and data use  
- Define RBAC for editable vs read-only requirement records  

---

## Tasks & Step-by-Step Instructions

### 1. Identify Stakeholders
- Map stakeholder influence and decision rights  
- Confirm availability for elicitation sessions

### 2. Choose Elicitation Techniques
- Use interviews, shadowing, surveys, observation, or workshops  
- Combine qualitative and quantitative inputs

### 3. Prepare Questions
- Use outcome-first prompts:  
  *✅ “What business problem are you trying to solve?”*  
  *❌ “Which feature do you want?”*

### 4. Conduct Sessions
- Take structured notes  
- Summarize and validate assumptions in-session  
- Record with permission (if policy allows)

### 5. Analyze Findings
- Cluster into themes: goals, constraints, must-haves, blockers  
- Identify conflicts or gaps for follow-up

### 6. Document Requirements
- Use consistent templates with acceptance criteria  
- Separate functional vs non-functional requirements

### 7. Validate With Stakeholders
- Share drafts for feedback  
- Highlight unclear or high-impact items for review

### 8. Prioritize
- Use scoring models (MoSCoW, Impact/Effort)  
- Align on MVP vs later-phase features

### 9. Manage Changes
- Implement change log with owner, impact, and timestamp  
- Route major changes through signoff loop

### 10. Obtain Formal Signoff
- Capture approvals via email or e-sign  
- Lock the scope before build begins

## Access Control & Permissions (RBAC guidelines)

| Role                  | Access Type         | Justification                              |
|-----------------------|---------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| Business Analyst      | Full Edit           | Requirement creation and stakeholder input |

| Technical Lead        | Read + Comment      | Technical feasibility reviews              |
| QA / UAT Owner        | Read-only           | Scope reference for test case mapping      |
| Security / Compliance | Review + Audit      | Ensure regulatory alignment                |

## Practical Examples & Templates (✅/❌)

### ✅ Good User Story

```markdown
As an HR lead,  
I want automated onboarding checklists,  
So that new hires complete all setup tasks on time.

### ❌ Bad Requirement

> “We should use AI here.”
> *No user, no intent, no success measure*

## Known Issues & Friction Points

| Issue                  | Impact                          | Suggested Fix                           |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Vague outcomes         | Leads to unclear features       | Refocus discussion on measurable goals  |
| Conflicting priorities | Stakeholder tension             | Escalate for decision or compromise     |
| Skipped stakeholders   | Missed constraints or blockers  | Map and engage early                    |
| Overengineering early  | Design bias before need clarity | Keep solutions out of requirement stage |
| Delayed sign-off       | Development bottlenecks         | Timebox reviews and set reminders       |

## Tips & Best Practices

### ✅ Do

* Paraphrase responses to confirm understanding
* Map business goals to specific requirement IDs
* Use visual workflows and mockups to clarify scope
* Iterate with low-fidelity drafts before final signoff

### ❌ Don’t

* Skip validation rounds
* Jump to features before defining the problem
* Use only templates—context matters
* Forget edge cases or regulatory scenarios

## Troubleshooting Guidance

| Symptom                    | Likely Cause                 | Recommended Action                     |
| -------------------------- | ---------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| "We meant something else…" | Misinterpreted user input    | Play back requirements for validation  |
| "This wasn’t in scope"     | Missing change tracking      | Audit the change log and impact notes  |
| "The tech team disagrees"  | Feasibility not vetted early | Include technical leads in workshops   |
| "This took too long"       | No prioritization discipline | Limit review cycles and timebox phases |
