# Change Readiness Assessment Snippets and Templates

A companion guide of modular snippets, templates, and scorecards to support structured change readiness assessments across teams. This enables repeatable evaluation, targeted planning, and aligned communication in enterprise change projects.

---

## Overview

Effective readiness assessments are driven by structure, clarity, and trust. These templates help you:

- Streamline stakeholder evaluations
- Standardize internal messaging
- Build credibility through consistency
- Accelerate synthesis and reporting

Each snippet is copy-paste ready for use in Confluence, Docs, dashboards, or messaging platforms like Slack, Teams, or Notion.

---

## Why It Matters

Readiness isn’t about optimism—it’s about preparedness. A structured assessment approach helps:

- Identify team-level blockers early
- Create targeted intervention plans
- Build a readiness heatmap to inform change strategy
- Reduce risk during rollout and increase adoption speed
- Translate sentiment into data-backed insights for sponsors

## Audience, Scope & Personas

| Role                  | Use Case                                         |
|-----------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Change Managers       | Conduct team assessments, plan interventions     |
| Project Sponsors      | Review readiness summaries, fund mitigation plans|
| Comms/HR Leads        | Tailor messaging and training per readiness level|
| Team Leads/SMEs       | Provide ground-level inputs                      |

This guide supports large-scale transformations, regional rollouts, and program-level readiness audits.

---

## Prerequisites

Before deploying these templates:

- ✅ Confirm stakeholder list and team-level access
- ✅ Align on readiness dimensions (e.g., Awareness, Capacity)
- ✅ Finalize rollout calendar and communication timelines
- ✅ Secure access to internal collaboration platforms
- ✅ Ensure data storage location meets compliance standards

---

## Security, Compliance & Privacy

- Store scorecards and responses securely in version-controlled systems  
- Remove personally identifiable information (PII) before external sharing  
- Use pseudonymized feedback where sensitive themes arise  
- Ensure GDPR/CCPA/ISO compliance when surveying multi-region teams  
- Label readiness materials as INTERNAL ONLY if not intended for clients or vendors

---

## Tasks & Step-by-Step Instructions

1. **Select Target Groups** – Identify departments impacted by the change.
2. **Distribute Templates** – Share scorecards, survey prompts, or Slack check-ins.
3. **Collect Inputs** – Use interviews, surveys, or workshops.
4. **Synthesize Results** – Convert responses into a heatmap or dashboard.
5. **Create Action Plans** – Assign owners and recommend interventions.
6. **Communicate Findings** – Summarize insights and escalate blockers.
7. **Monitor Progress** – Reassess readiness levels at key project milestones.

## Practical Examples & Templates (✅/❌)

### ✅ Scorecard Snippet

```markdown
| Readiness Dimension         | Team/Group       | Readiness Rating | Supporting Notes                                   |
|----------------------------|------------------|------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| Awareness & Understanding  | Sales            | Medium (65%)     | Confusion about rollout timelines and impact scope |
````

### ❌ Poor Practice

> "Sales is fine, they’ll figure it out."
> *Missing structured feedback, no metrics, unclear sentiment.*

---

## Survey Prompt Framing (❌ vs ✅)

| ❌ Avoid                                 | ✅ Use                                                           |
| --------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| "Do you feel excited about the change?" | "How prepared do you feel for the upcoming change? (1–5 scale)" |
| "Will this help your work?"             | "Which part of your daily workflow will be most impacted?"      |

---

## Action Planning Snippet

```markdown
📍 Team: Support Ops  
📉 Readiness Rating: Low (35%)  
🧭 Gaps:  
- Lack of awareness  
- Past failed migrations  
🛠 Actions:  
- Custom onboarding session  
- Slack Q&A channel  
- Anonymous fear survey  
👤 Owner: Regional Change Lead  
📅 Deadline: July 15  
```

---

## Interview / Focus Group Prompts

```markdown
1. How prepared do you feel for this change?
2. What do you still need to feel confident?
3. What challenges have you faced during past rollouts?
4. What specific support would you find most useful?
5. Are there blockers we should raise to leadership?
```

---

## Informal Check-In (Slack/Email)

```markdown
📢 Quick Readiness Check-In – [Project Name]  
1–5: How ready are you feeling today?  
What's one thing that would help most?  
Any blockers or confusion?  
DM me or reply here—thanks!  
```

---

## Workshop Setup Template

```markdown
🧠 Title: "How Ready Are We?"  
🎯 Goals: Spot blockers, co-create success, identify training needs  
📋 Agenda:  
- 10 min intro  
- 20 min team breakouts  
- 15 min shareback

## Known Issues & Friction Points

| Issue                          | Impact                       | Suggested Resolution                             |
| ------------------------------ | ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| Incomplete inputs              | Inaccurate readiness picture | Recheck with skip-level interviews               |
| Biased responses               | Skewed sentiment metrics     | Use anonymous surveys where needed               |
| Resistance to self-assessments | Delayed insights             | Frame assessments as improvement, not evaluation |

---

## Tips & Best Practices

* Use consistent rating scales across all tools
* Keep templates lightweight and editable
* Mix methods (quant + qual) to get full picture
* Share back insights quickly to build feedback loops
* Create role-specific prompts (e.g., for leadership vs. delivery teams)

## Troubleshooting Guidance

| Symptom                   | Likely Cause                         | Fix                                        |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------ |
| "No one's filling it out" | Low engagement / unclear request     | Use informal nudge via Slack or 1:1s       |
| "Responses are too vague" | Prompt not specific enough           | Reframe with role-based or job impact cues |
| "Everything says Medium"  | Lack of clarity on scale definitions | Calibrate scale definitions before scoring |

---

## Dependencies, Risks & Escalation Path

| Dependency             | Description                             |
| ---------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| SME availability       | For focus groups and guided scorecards  |
| Communication timeline | Required to sync readiness with rollout |
| Leadership alignment   | Needed to act on mitigation plans       |

| Risk                      | Mitigation Strategy                       |
| ------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Skipped groups            | Use org chart and rollout map to confirm  |
| Stakeholder defensiveness | Pre-frame with empathy + outcome framing  |
| Readiness data misused    | Limit exposure and contextualize findings |

---

Continual use and refinement of readiness snippets increases change transparency, stakeholder trust, and execution velocity. Treat readiness as a pulse, not a one-time event.
