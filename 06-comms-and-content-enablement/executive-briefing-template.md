# Executive Briefing Template

---

## Overview

This template supports concise, decision-focused communication with executive teams. It enables communicators to present high-level summaries, progress updates, challenges, and calls to action in a format optimized for leadership attention spans and strategic decision-making.

---

## Why It Matters

A well-structured executive briefing:

- Enables **quick comprehension** of status, risks, and next steps  
- Helps executives **prioritize support and resources**  
- Escalates blockers **before they become business risks**  
- Builds **credibility and trust** with senior leaders  
- Ensures clear **accountability and ownership**  
- Strengthens alignment between operational progress and executive vision  

Poor briefings lead to missed decisions, delays, and confidence loss.

| ------------------- | ------------------ | ------------------------------------ |

| Chiefs of Staff     | Gatekeeping        | Validate timing and alignment        |

---

## Practical Examples & Templates (✅/❌)

### ✅ Strong Executive Summary

> **Phase 1 is 85% complete.**
> We are on track for Aug 15 launch, pending two security reviews.
> Decision required: Allocate 2 FTEs by Aug 1 to prevent \$120K delay.

### ❌ Weak Executive Summary

> Things are moving. Some blockers, but we're progressing overall.

---

### ✅ Ask Template

| Decision Needed               | Recommendation        | Rationale                                      |
| ----------------------------- | --------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Approve 2 additional analysts | Assign from L\&D team | Will enable timely onboarding across 3 regions |

---

## Known Issues & Friction Points

| Issue                   | Impact                      | Fix                                       |
| ----------------------- | --------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Burying the ask         | Leaders miss the decision   | Lead with ask and repeat in conclusion    |
| Overloading with detail | Skimmed or ignored briefing | Shift to appendix or dashboard link       |
| No mitigation stated    | Causes concern, not clarity | Pair every challenge with a mitigation    |
| Lack of formatting      | Harder to skim              | Use bullets, bolding, headers, whitespace |
| Unclear ownership       | Follow-up confusion         | Use task–owner–date format                |

---

## Tips & Best Practices

- **Think like an executive**: What’s the decision or risk they need to see?
- **Write tight**: Every section should be skimmable in under 10 seconds.
- **Anticipate questions**: Include rationale and optional appendix links.
- **Use bolding for key phrases**: e.g., “Launch Delay Risk = \$120K”
- **Pre-brief aides when needed**: Avoid surprises in exec reviews.

## Troubleshooting Guidance

| Symptom                         | Likely Cause           | Recommended Fix                          |
| ------------------------------- | ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| “Ask wasn’t clear”              | Buried in body         | Put ask in subject and top section       |
| “Too long to read”              | Overexplained sections | Limit to 5 bullets/section + appendix    |
| “Not aligned with PMO timeline” | Missed validation      | Sync with PMO, add milestone reference   |
| “No ownership listed”           | Action lines unclear   | Include task, owner, and deadline rows   |
| “Stakeholders surprised”        | No dry run             | Circulate preview to key reviewers early |

---

## Dependencies, Risks & Escalation Path

### Dependencies

- PMO for timeline and ownership confirmation
- Internal Comms for language and formatting
- Legal/Finance for compliance-sensitive updates
- Data/Analytics for validated metrics

### Escalation Path

- Unclear approvals → escalate via Chief of Staff
- Decision delay → flag in leadership sync deck
- Stakeholder misalignment → pre-brief or schedule 1:1 review
