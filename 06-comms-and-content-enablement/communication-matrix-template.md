# Communication Matrix Template

---

## Overview

The Communication Matrix is a strategic planning tool to ensure the right messages reach the right stakeholders at the right time, through the right channels. It structures messaging for internal rollouts, change programs, and cross-functional initiatives, minimizing confusion and reducing resistance.

---

## Why It Matters

Inconsistent communication undermines adoption, alignment, and credibility. A structured matrix improves outcomes by:

- Clarifying message purpose and audience segmentation
- Avoiding repetition or conflicting updates
- Assigning clear ownership and timelines
- Supporting audit trails and compliance in regulated environments

It transforms messaging into a strategic layer of operational success.

* Impact tier (high, medium, low)
* Function (Exec, Team Lead, Staff)
* Region or language

• Employees → Action Items, FAQs, Help Channels  
```
