# Risk Mitigation Plan

---

## Overview

This document offers a structured process to identify, evaluate, and mitigate risks associated with enterprise change. It provides reusable templates and checklists to help cross-functional teams track potential threats, communicate proactively, and build stakeholder confidence through preparation.

---

## Why It Matters

Risks left unacknowledged become blockers. Risks left unmanaged become failures.

A structured risk mitigation plan:

- Uncovers blockers early in the change lifecycle  
- Facilitates transparent, cross-team communication  
- Builds a repeatable culture of risk ownership  
- Reduces fire-fighting and emergency escalations  
- Drives higher adoption and smoother rollouts through preparedness  

---

## Audience, Scope & Personas

### Audience

- Change Managers  
- Project Managers & PMO Leads  
- Internal Communications Teams  
- Department Owners & Risk Champions  

### Scope

This guide applies to internal risks in transformation programs:

- Technology rollouts  
- Policy/process overhauls  
- Organizational change initiatives  

It does **not** replace legal risk assessments, investor disclosures, or insurance planning.

---

## Prerequisites

- ✅ Completed change impact assessment  
- ✅ Stakeholder mapping with risk domains (e.g., IT, HR, Legal)  
- ✅ Agreed risk appetite and escalation thresholds  
- ✅ Assigned risk owners by business function  
- ✅ Setup of a shared workspace or Confluence tracker  

---

## Security, Compliance & Privacy

- Store risk logs and trackers in secured, access-controlled repositories  
- Use role-based permissions to restrict editing of mitigation logs  
- Do not disclose sensitive legal, financial, or personal impact data outside approved groups  
- Mark unresolved critical risks with appropriate severity tags (P1/P2, RED/AMBER)  
- Maintain an audit trail of status updates and decision rationales  

---

## Tasks & Step-by-Step Instructions

### 1. Identify and Categorize Risks

- Run risk workshops, stakeholder interviews, or retrospectives  
- Use categories: Operational, Technical, Compliance, People, Timeline, or Reputation  
- Assign scores for **likelihood** (1–5) and **impact** (1–5)  
- Use heatmaps or matrices to visualize critical hotspots  

### 2. Define Mitigation Strategies

- For each risk, define 1–3 mitigation actions  
- Include fallback options (contingency if Plan A fails)  
- Assign a single owner, deadline, and dependency  
- Track current status: Active, Resolved, Escalated, Planned  

### 3. Communicate and Review

- Share risk tables with project leads, execs, and risk owners  
- Embed risk updates in weekly standups or exec dashboards  
- Archive resolved risks and log learnings for future initiatives

## Access Control & Permissions (RBAC guidelines)

| Role               | Permission         | Justification                          |
|--------------------|--------------------|----------------------------------------|
| PMO / Change Lead  | Full edit          | Owns risk log, scheduling, coordination|
| Department Heads   | Read + comment     | Validate ownership + suggest actions   |
| Comms Team         | Comment only       | Align messaging across risk comms      |
| IT / HR / Legal    | Edit domain risks  | Add mitigation specifics and updates   |
| Executives         | Read-only          | Consume summary, track status          |

| Risk Description                     | Category     | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation Strategy                          | Owner        | Status   |
|-------------------------------------|--------------|------------|--------|----------------------------------------------|--------------|----------|
| Key system offline during rollout   | Technical    | High (5)   | High   | Full simulation + fallback environment       | IT Lead      | Active   |
| Low engagement from team leads      | Operational  | Medium (3) | High   | 1:1 cascade briefing + Slack reminders       | Comms Manager| Planned  |
| Policy ambiguity                    | Compliance   | Low (2)    | High   | Legal review + clarification comms           | Legal Team   | Resolved |

### ✅ Executive Risk Summary

```markdown
**Top Risk This Week:**  
📉 Only 42% training completion rate before go-live.  

📍 **Impact:** Possible compliance breach, rollout delay.  
🧠 **Mitigation:** Extend deadline, auto-reminder to managers, lock access post-deadline.  
👤 **Owner:** L&D Lead – North Zone  
📅 **Next Review:** August 2nd

## Known Issues & Friction Points

| Symptom                   | Likely Cause                         | Suggested Fix                                  |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Risk log becomes stale    | No owner assigned for upkeep         | Assign PMO or BAU risk steward with SLA        |
| Risks too vague or broad  | Poor workshop facilitation           | Use guided templates or SME co-authoring       |
| Delayed mitigation action | Dependencies not flagged             | Highlight blockers and tag escalation lead     |
| Disagreement on scoring   | Inconsistent risk rating definitions | Align on scoring rubric with example scenarios |

---

## Tips & Best Practices

✅ Do:

- Embed risk updates into weekly standups or retrospectives
- Use tags like `#showstopper`, `#P1`, `#cross-functional`
- Update statuses consistently, even if nothing changed
- Share a summary view for execs (3–5 key risks only)

❌ Don’t:

- Let vague risks stay in the log without action steps
- Assume teams will flag blockers unless prompted
- Wait for risks to materialize before starting conversations
- Bury high-risk items in long documents—highlight and flag

## Troubleshooting Guidance

| Problem                     | Resolution                                     | Risk if Ignored                            |
| --------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| High-risk items missing     | Re-run cross-functional risk workshop          | Critical gaps, post-mortem finger-pointing |
| Risk status outdated        | Add weekly review calendar block               | Decisions based on old assumptions         |
| Owners unclear or rotating  | Link risk to role, not individual only         | Accountability gaps                        |
| Too many low-priority risks | Prioritize by Heat Score (Impact × Likelihood) | Focus wasted, critical risks missed        |

## Dependencies, Risks & Escalation Path

### Dependencies

| Dependency          | Description                                  |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| SME Inputs          | Risk mapping workshops and scoring           |
| Approval Cadence    | Risk items tied to go/no-go gates or phases  |
| Change Impact Grid  | Connect risks to stakeholder journey stages  |
| Mitigation Capacity | Resource availability for mitigation actions |

### Escalation Path

| Trigger                          | Escalation Owner | Action                                 |
| -------------------------------- | ---------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Risk unresolved >2 review cycles | PMO/Change Lead  | Trigger escalation deck for leadership |
| Cross-team disagreement          | Program Sponsor  | Schedule risk mediation or override    |
| Legal/Compliance exposure        | Legal Director   | Move to audit track                    |
